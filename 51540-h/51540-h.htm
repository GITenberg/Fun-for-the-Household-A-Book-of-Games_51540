<h2>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>


<p>When children have passed beyond the rattle age,
they reach out their hands for baa-lambs, woolly sheep,
cows with bells, cats that meaw, and dogs that say
bow-wow.</p>

<p>The next advance in amusement is to play with a toy
that goes on wheels, and therefore for a half hour at a
time, little folk will be content by drawing around the
nursery such toys as trains of cars, horses with long
tails, express wagons, etc., etc.; and then follows the
period when pretty lady dolls must go out to drive in
a pretty carriage accompanied by mistress baby, whose
chubby hands push the doll’s carriage ahead, and
nurse’s ever vigilant eyes keep watch, so that neither
baby nor the baby’s doll, like the historic Jack and
Jill, fall down and break their crown. And mechanical
dollies are also in demand,—lady dolls that lift their
veils, smile and bow; gentlemen dolls that are orchestrian
leaders; boy dolls that can turn somersaults
and effect other athletic feats. And about this time if
nurse is careful to keep sharp eyes on the scissors,
colored pictures may be cut out and pasted in scrapbooks,
or paper dolls may be arrayed as their youthful
mothers desire. Or bright pieces of silk may be sewed
together, provided the thread is tied into the needle’s
eye, so that it cannot be pulled out. Or wonderful
castles may be built with packs of cards, or towers and
steeples with building blocks. Noah’s ark will do
great service, as will also tops that spin, and hoops that
may be rolled or twirled, and drums that may be beat,
and whistles and horns that may be blown.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding all the toys and amusement
therefrom, there will be heard the oftentimes plaintive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
wail, “Play with me, please play with me.” And then
it is that the wise mother or nurse will introduce a
simple game. Perhaps Puss in the Corner, or Blind
Man’s Buff, or perhaps hide behind a large chair or
screen and call aloud, “Where am I?” and such a
mischievous laugh will follow when the toddling child
finds the one who has thus hidden!</p>

<p>From this period game follows game, just as naturally
as year follows year, and even when the little tot
has grown to womanhood or manhood, the cry is still
heard, “Play with me, please play with me,” thus illustrating
the trite words, men and women are only
children grown up.</p>

<p>Therefore the variety of games within this book:
Games suitable for all ages, for all temperaments;
games for the house, and games for the field; games
for the girls, and, games for the boys; games for the
young, and games for the old; games for St. Valentine’s
Day, games for Christmas Day,—games for all
seasons, games for all climes. Thus may the year be
filled with jollity.</p>

<p>Several games in this volume were originally published
in the periodicals of Messrs. Harper &amp; Brothers,
and are reprinted by their kind permission.</p>

<h2>FUN FOR THE HOUSEHOLD.</h2>

<h2>LITTLE FOLKS.</h2>


<h3>A LITTLE CHILD’S PARTY.</h3>

<p>Invite both boys and girls for a short
frolic. Between three and five o’clock in
the afternoon would be excellent hours.</p>

<p>Provide for their entertainment, flowers,
birds, worsted and rubber balls, dolls, tea-services,
horses, whips, and music. If you
have a music-box it will prove very serviceable.
The children will be much interested;
some of the shorter ones will stand on tiptoe,
the better to discover the way the wheels
go around.</p>

<p>Two or more grown people should
be present; those who understand little
children, and have a knack in amusing
them.</p>

<p>The toys will greatly aid in getting the
children acquainted. Play ball with the
boys, throwing it lightly back and forth.
Set out the tea-services. Show off the dollies.
Put a small boy on a hobby horse,
and start the horse on a trot, and after he
has his ride, give another boy his turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
After a while play polkas and waltzes, and
then</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">What a merry rout,</div>
<div class="verse">See the wee ones dance about!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Change the amusement. Show them
flowers, canary birds, butterflies, anything
you may have to attract, always remembering
the toys and going back to them again
and again.</p>

<p>Low chairs and hassocks will make it
easier for the little people than to have to
climb into the great chairs and sofas used
by older folks.</p>

<p>Refreshments should be exceedingly simple,
and a souvenir, such as a cornucopia
or handful of motto-papers, gayly tinted and
full of candy, will be much appreciated.</p>


<h3>THE FARMER’S SONG.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Motion Game.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As over the field the farmer goes,</div>
<div class="verse">And grain by grain he sows in the rows,</div>
<div class="verse">He sings and shouts, Oh, you crows, you crows,</div>
<div class="verse">Keep away from my rows, away from my rows.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This is the way the glad farmer reaps</div>
<div class="verse">His wheat, and when it is bunched he keeps</div>
<div class="verse">An eye on all his workers around,</div>
<div class="verse">And laughs at their faces, merry and round.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">This is the way the glad farmer binds</div>
<div class="verse">All the ripe sheaves he’s able to find,</div>
<div class="verse">And when no more wheat is on the ground,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>He laughs ha, ha, ha, and turns all around.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Hurrah, hurrah for the farmer bold</div>
<div class="verse">He laughs and is merry e’en when ’tis cold,</div>
<div class="verse">He shouts ha, ha, on an August day,</div>
<div class="verse">And gathers his wheat as if ’twas his play.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, who would not be a farmer lad,</div>
<div class="verse">And clap one’s hands hard and never be sad,</div>
<div class="verse">And sing, while working all the day long,</div>
<div class="verse">I’m jolly and happy and brave and strong?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Let all the players form a ring, with a boy
in the centre for farmer. After the song is
sung through, the farmer must choose two
players to clasp their hands and raise them,
thus forming an arch. The ring having
broken, now forms a long line, and one by
one each individual passes under the arch,
singing as they go,</p>

<div class="center">
Oh, who would not be a farmer lad,
</div>

<p class="unindent">and with the last word of the verse the arch
falls, and thus some one is caught, and he
or she is now farmer. A ring is then again
formed, and the game proceeds as before.</p>

<p>This being a motion game, the words of
the song must be acted. Every child has
seen farmers sow, reap and bind, and while
singing those words they must copy the
farmer (the boy in the ring) as nearly as
possible, also remember to clap the hands,
turn around, etc., at the proper time, indeed
lose no opportunity to act the words as
well as to sing them. Tune, “Oats, peas,
beans, and barley grows.”</p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the time merrily singing his song.</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when we are through we ask yet for more,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">While we dance on the baker’s clean wood floor.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then we run as fast as we can,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leave this jolly baker man,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">While to the oven he hurries along,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the time merrily singing his song.</span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The verses may be sung to the tune, “Pop
Goes the Weasel.” The solo is sung by the
baker, to the tune, “Coming Through the
Rye.”</p>

<p>All the children should sing and imitate
the pieman, who illustrates each action that
is mentioned.</p>


<h3>FLY SOUTH.</h3>

<p>Very small children would delight in playing
Fly South.</p>

<p>All the players should sit around a table,
and each having put their right hand on it,
the leader should exclaim, “Fly South,
Sparrow.” The second that this is said
everybody must lift their hand, and then at
once put it down as before. Again the
leader speaks, perhaps to say, “Fly South,
Pigeon,” and instantly the players must act
as at the first command.</p>

<p>But if on the contrary something is named
that cannot fly, such as, “Fly South, Bear,”
or “Fly South, Cat,” the players must keep
their hands on the table. All removing them
at the wrong time should pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>The leader should speak rapidly, in order
to catch all he can.</p>


<h3>THREE BLIND MICE.</h3>

<p>Ask three small boys to be blindfolded.
When this is done, and they each state that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
they cannot see, even the least little bit, a
big sister or mother should say, “You are
three blind mice and I am the farmer’s
wife, and I am going to run, and as soon as I
count three you must run after me. Whoever
catches me first shall have a big apple; whoever
catches me second shall have two big
apples; and when I am caught by the third
I shall present that blind mouse with three
big apples.”</p>

<p>Having made the above explanation, the
farmer’s wife deliberately counts one, two,
three, and on the instant three is spoken,
the blind mice run.</p>

<p>As soon as the running starts, all others
sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Three blind mice, see how they run,</div>
<div class="verse">They all ran after the farmer’s wife.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This may be sung over and over until the
blind mice succeed. Having run a few moments,
the farmer’s wife should allow herself
to be caught, as this game being particularly
suited to little children, they would
not have the skill in catching known to
older people.</p>

<p>If it is not convenient to give apples as
reward, substitute something else. Almost
any trifling gift would do.</p>

<p>While running is in continuance, be careful
the children do not trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE HOLIDAY CALENDAR.</h3>

<p>“I have a holiday calendar,” a little boy
should say to a little girl.</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Here.” And directly he holds up his
hand with fingers spread towards her.</p>

<p>“See my five fingers. They stand for
our five holidays.” Then touching his
thumb he should continue,</p>

<p>“This is for Mayday, so sweet,” and then
touching the finger next, “Jolly Fourth,
with its noise,” afterwards indicating the
middle finger, “Thanksgiving and pumpkin
pies,” and touching the next finger,
“Christmas, for girls and boys,” and holding
up his little finger concludes, “Happy
New Year to all.”</p>


<h3>THE SEA AND HER CHILDREN.</h3>

<p>The players, with the exception of one
sent from the room, must be seated in a
circle. The person having left will represent
the Sea. All others must now decide
on an assumed name, which is also the
name of a fish; for example, trout, red
snapper, pickerel. This done, the Sea returns
and walks slowly around the outside
of the ring, calling her children, one after
another, by the different names they have
selected, until all have risen and followed
her. Then the Sea must run with a varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
motion, sometimes rapid, sometimes slow,
exclaiming, “The Sea is troubled! the Sea
is troubled!” Suddenly she seats herself,
and her example is followed by her children.
The unfortunate individual who is unable to
secure a chair becomes the Sea, and the
game is continued as before.</p>


<h3>CINDERELLA’S SLIPPER.</h3>

<p>Every child has heard the pretty story of
Cinderella and her glass slipper. Now learn
who will have bright enough eyes to find it.</p>

<p>The fairy godmother cannot really let you
have Cinderella’s slipper, but she allows any
of the children to hunt for a slipper that is
made of fur, or trimmed with fur. This
slipper should have Cinderella’s card pinned
to it, and whoever finds the slipper should
be given the card as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Cinderella’s slipper should be well hidden,
but not where little people could not reach.
While the hunt is in progress, whoever has
hidden the slipper should call “Warm,
Warmer, Cold, Colder,” as the children get
nearer or further away.</p>


<h3>THE MAN IN THE MOON.</h3>

<p>Have a circle two feet in diameter cut out
of plain white paper. At the time the game
is to be played some one should pin this on
the back of the Lord of Misrule. He must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
then whistle and caper all about the room,
thus attracting attention, and seat himself
at the piano, and sing at the top of his
lungs,</p>

<div class="center">
Girls and boys, come out to play.</div>

<p>As soon as he sings the word <i>play</i>, every
girl and boy rushes forward and catching
each other by the hand, they dance and skip
about to the tune played by the Lord of
Misrule, while all sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Girls and boys come out to play,</div>
<div class="verse">The moon doth shine as bright as day,</div>
<div class="verse">Leave your supper and leave your sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">And meet your playfellows in the street,</div>
<div class="verse">Come with a whoop and come with a call.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The second the words whoop and call are
uttered the most throat-splitting whoops and
calls should be given; such as cat calls,
wild beast groans, crying, barking, bird
notes, etc. The circle disbands during the
laughter and confusion, but the game may
be played over and over as long as the Man
of the Moon shall will.</p>


<h3>HOW MANY?</h3>

<p>This is really a game of guess. Shake a
small bag full of beans before the children,
and ask each to guess how many beans are
inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be amusing to watch the eagerness
which all will show, and how far apart the
guesses will be.</p>

<p>Whoever comes nearest to the correct
number should be presented with the bag of
beans. And this gift will immediately afford
healthful and jolly entertainment, because
the bean-bag should be tossed and caught
by one and another until the rosy-cheeked
and out-of-breath children call a halt.</p>


<h3>ALPHABETICAL PLAY.</h3>

<p>Cut out a square of cardboard, six inches
wide by six inches long. Put an eyelet in
each of the two upper corners and run tape
or ribbon through. Cut it of sufficient length
to go over a child’s head. The children
should wear the cardboard as if it was a
breastplate.</p>

<p>You should have twenty-six children, and
you will therefore require twenty-six pieces
of cardboard. In the centre of each piece,
paint a letter of the alphabet. Should you
have fewer children, paint two or more
letters on each cardboard, for you must use
the entire alphabet.</p>

<p>The children should first march up and
down in alphabetical order, keeping time to
music. They may then join hands in couples
and skip or waltz or whatever pleasing movements
may be suggested.</p>

<p>After these exercises call for words, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
careful which words you will require if you
have doubled or trebled the letters. As each
word is called, the child wearing the first
letter steps forward, then the one wearing the
second letter comes and stands by her side,
and so on, until the word is spelled.</p>

<p>Very short and simple words should be
called if the children are not sufficiently
advanced to allow for longer or more difficult
ones. Dog, Cat, Bird, will furnish just
as much amusement as Prodigy, Yclept,
Bask.</p>

<p>Intersperse the word exercises with
marches and other movements, such as
“Right-about-face,” to be done by a chord,
or “wheel to the left,” to be done by another.
Form squares and circles. Join
hands, thus making a ring. Into this ring the
letter A goes, the others skip around her, until
she makes a motion like something commencing
with A; for example, Apple, which she
pretends to eat. One or more of the company
guesses what word she represents, and
then B enters the ring, and so on as long as
the game amuses.</p>


<h3>BLINDFOLDED PLATTER TWIRLING.</h3>

<p>This game is similar to the old-time favorite.</p>

<p>All players should sit in a circle, and each
number themselves in rotation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Two of the party should be blindfolded.
They are then each given a platter, and they
enter the ring.</p>

<p>The others call, one, two, three. As soon
as three is called, those inside the ring twirl
the platters, and at the same moment they
each shout a number which corresponds to
two of the players in the circle. Should
either of the bearers of the numbers catch
his platter before it falls, the original twirler
must try over again and continue to twirl
and call until the platter is not caught.</p>

<p>But should the platter have fallen before
the child bearing the number called has
caught it, he must not only change places
with the one who has twirled the platter, but
also pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>Much amusement is derived, not only
from catching the platter, but in watching
the ridiculous movements of those who are
blindfolded.</p>


<h3>THE WILD BEAST EXHIBIT.</h3>

<p>By the side of a pier-glass stand a lamp,
and before both put a screen.</p>

<p>The one in charge stands in front, and having
stated that he is ready to exhibit his wild
beasts to any one present who will not tell
what he has seen, asks who would like to
come to the exhibition, all desiring to, please
rise. He then takes them in turn, always
exacting the promise of secrecy, and asks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the name of the animal each would like to
see.</p>

<p>On learning the name, the showman describes
the animal as funnily as possible,
making all manner of sport, and engaging
every one’s attention to the individual who
is to go to the show. As for example, if
the person be a boy, and says he would like
to see a lion, when the boy laughs, the
showman will say, “And the lion roars
<i>just like you</i>.” After this he is admitted, and
sees himself in the looking-glass.</p>


<h3>NEW TAG.</h3>

<p>The tallest player should begin the game.</p>

<p>This person turning to the first right hand
player should say “Yes”; to the second,
“No”; and so on all around, saying yes or
no, as the case may be, to yourself last.
Whoever is the last person to whom “No”
is said, however, is out of the game, and the
one who commenced the game, again goes
around the ring. If she has said “Yes” to
herself last, then the one to her right hand
is now told “No,” and thus “Yes,” “No,”
is said all around again and again and so on,
until there are but two players. Whichever
one is Yes, must then be “It.”</p>

<p>All the players now stand at a given distance
from “It,” and a tree or object being
selected as a place of safety, they are ready
to begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“It” calls to the others, “One foot off,”
then each player raises one of their feet.
“Two feet on,” at which order everybody’s
feet are immediately upon the sidewalk.
“Two feet off,” may then be called, at which
order all rush at their utmost speed, and “It”
after them. Should anybody be caught before
reaching the tree of safety, that person
must change places with “It,” and the game
continues as before.</p>

<p>The orders, “One foot off,” “Two feet
on,” etc., should be called very rapidly, so
that everybody is mixed up and will not
suspect when two feet off will be called.
Sometimes the orders are repeated over and
over, and again, “Two feet off” may be
said the first time.</p>


<h3>THE GREENGROCER.</h3>

<p>Any boy may start the game, by saying,
“I am a greengrocer and I sell O.” All of
the children must now guess what the
grocer would have for sale that would commence
with the letter O.</p>

<p>He means he has onions for sale. Whoever
is the first to guess, whether it is a girl
or a boy, now becomes the greengrocer
and uses the same words as before, only
substituting another letter. Perhaps the
greengrocer has cucumbers or carrots for
sale; in that case he would sell C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>This game is capable of a variety of
changes, for example, “I am a milliner, and
I am going to put F on your hat.” All the
girls must now guess what a milliner could
put on a hat that would commence with F,
and some one is not long in deciding that the
milliner means “Flowers.”</p>

<p>The next milliner may say, “I am a
milliner and I am going to put D flowers on
your hat.”</p>

<p>And all must think what varieties of
flowers commence with the letter D, and
in a second some one calls out, “Daisies.”</p>

<p>This being correct, the one who has
guessed becomes milliner.</p>

<p>In like manner a boy may say, “I am a
New York jeweler, and I sell G,” and all the
players must think what a jeweler could
offer for sale that would commence with
the letter G.</p>

<p>Soon a voice asks, “Is it Gold?” But
that is not correct, this jeweler is selling
Garnets.</p>

<p>Or the game may be confined to a country.
Example: “I am a Japanese merchant and
I sell S.”</p>

<p>The players must think what the merchant
has for sale that comes from Japan, and
that commences with the letter S.</p>

<p>Thus with care this game may be played
by a small child with as much success as by
an adult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<h3>RUBIES AND EMERALDS.</h3>

<p>Two players decide as to which one will
represent rubies and which emeralds, without
telling the others.</p>

<p>They then join hands to form an arch.
All the rest take hold of each other’s jackets
or frocks, and while going through the arch
they sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">All of a row,</div>
<div class="verse">Bend the bow,</div>
<div class="verse">Shot at a pigeon</div>
<div class="verse">And killed a crow.</div>
<div class="verse">The cock doth crow</div>
<div class="verse">To let you know,</div>
<div class="verse">If you be well.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The second that the last word is sung,
those who have formed the arch drop their
arms around the neck of the child just passing
under. Then they inquire in a whisper
which he would rather have, Rubies or Emeralds.
When he decides, he must whisper
the answer, and he will then be told to go
back of the player that represents that stone.</p>

<p>When all have been caught, those back of
the stone that has had the most admirers
now hide, while the others seek for them.
Should the rubies have precedence, the emeralds
are the ones to hunt, or if the emeralds,
the rubies are the ones to hunt. Whichever
stone is in the minority must seek for the
others. Whoever finds the most rubies or
emeralds, as the case may be, is counted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
richest, as this player possesses the most
treasure.</p>

<p>The players who have formed the arch
keep watch that all is done fairly.</p>


<h3>WHAT THE DANDELIONS SAID</h3>

<p>Is the old game familiar to all from babyhood—that
of blowing the soft down of the
ripened dandelion to learn, “How old am
I?” Blow once, one year old; blow twice,
two years, and so on, until all the downy
stuff has gone. The number of times the
blows have been given before the down has
altogether disappeared indicates the age.</p>

<p>Or, “What time is it?”</p>

<p>This is indicated in the same way. Blow
once, and if all the down is gone, it is one
o’clock, twice, two o’clock, and so on.</p>


<h3>DAISY CATCH.</h3>

<p>All the boys and girls should stand in a
group, with the exception of one girl, and to
her is given a bunch of daisies. She is
known as “Daisy Girl.” A tree is selected
as a place of safety and the other girls count
ten, allowing ten seconds for the count.
During the counting, Daisy Girl runs wherever
she pleases, but the moment ten is
spoken, the boys and girls may race after
her. The idea is to tag her while the flowers
are in her hand. If she is tagged the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
must then throw the daisies as if they were
a ball to the boy or girl tagging her. If
they are caught the game proceeds as before,
by reversing the players, but if the flowers
are not caught, Daisy Girl may try again.
She may also demand another chance, if,
when fearing she would be tagged, she
throws the daisies away, and catches them
again before any of the other players. When
the game is repeated it commences regularly
from the beginning, the players taking the
same position as at the start.</p>


<h3>DIBBS.</h3>

<p>This is the English name for Jack-Stones.</p>

<p>Where a number of children are playing
together, test who can pick up the greater
number without dropping any, within ten
minutes.</p>

<p>The oldest child should keep count, and
also watch the time, in order that no mistakes
occur. The counter should have each
of the players’ names written on a slate
or piece of paper, with sufficient room for
his scores. When a Dibb or Jack-Stone
has been dropped, this party must commence
afresh. He, however, may yet win;
for his opponents may drop many more
Dibbs than he. The only score to count is
after the last Dibb has been dropped. A
player might have reached a score of thirty
or more, but having failed to catch his Dibb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
it drops and he must now count one, two,
and so on without regard to former count.</p>

<p>When the ten minutes have expired, the
counter should call “Game,” and the players
must stop on the second.</p>


<h3>TOUCH.</h3>

<p>This game is for little children, though it
may be played by children of all ages. It
is at its best as an out-of-door recreation.</p>

<p>Chalk off a part of a lawn or use a small
grass plot. On this put a number of paper-covered
packages. Then blindfold one of
the children, and, in the sight of all the
others, touch a package. When this is done
the blindfold may be removed, and the
child told he may have all the packages for
his own, until he takes the one touched, then
he must stop. Sometimes the player is unfortunate
enough to pick up the touched
package first, if so, he must surrender this
also, unless the players vote he may try
again. No one may try more than twice.</p>

<p>On the contrary an occasional child may
pick up every package before the one
touched, when that happens the touched
package is also added as a reward.</p>

<p>This game interests all, and when the
touched package is picked up, the children
scream with laughter. The contents of the
packages may be a little candy, inexpensive
toys, an apple, pear or other fruits, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
nuts. Each present is temptingly wrapped,
and as this game is played over and over
no one gift should cost beyond a penny or
two. It makes great fun to undo the packages,
and generous children always divide
with the unfortunate.</p>


<h3>SNAPPING-ROPES.</h3>

<p>This is a Scotch game, usually played by
girls, but there is no reason why boys should
not play also.</p>

<p>Two skipping-ropes are required. Two
players turn the pair of ropes, holding the
ends of both ropes in one hand precisely
the same as if they were turning a single
rope, and the third player stands between
and jumps. Whoever is jumper cannot be
lazy, as that party has to jump twice as
rapidly as if jumping in a single rope.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>




<h2>BOYS AND GIRLS.</h2>


<h3>SILHOUETTES.</h3>

<p>Place a lighted candle behind a tall screen
covered with white linen. The hostess
should sit before it and each of the company
must in turn pass between the candle
and the screen. The game is to guess the
person behind the screen by means of their
shadow.</p>

<p>The guesser should leave the room while
the one to be named is selected, and on returning,
he should not look to find out who
is missing, but honestly guess from the silhouette.</p>

<p>Sometimes it adds to the fun to use a disguise,
as at a masquerade, for example, put
on a long skirt, fasten up the hair, etc., in
no case cover the face, as it is difficult to
give the right name, with every advantage.</p>


<h3>THE SURPRISE.</h3>

<p>Learn what you can do with five pieces
of paper. The margin of a newspaper may
be utilized if no other paper is convenient.
These pieces should be one inch long by
half an inch wide. The scheme is to shape
them into squares, triangles, etc., the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
who wins the game is the one who can accomplish
the most with his five pieces.</p>

<p>He need not use the entire five each time,
but he cannot add to the number of papers,
nor can he mark them with pen, pencil or
any other thing.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the whole alphabet
can be formed with them, and so many
other unique designs that this game fully
merits its name.</p>


<h3>HAPHAZARD READING.</h3>

<p>To be played by nine people; should
there be more present, draw for the players.
And, as but one of the party will read, draw
to decide which one.</p>

<p>The reader then, having a pencil and
paper, writes the parts of speech, as the
players in turn whisper to him:</p>

<p>No. 1. An Article.</p>

<p>No. 2. An Adjective.</p>

<p>No. 3. A Noun.</p>

<p>No. 4. A Verb.</p>

<p>No. 5. An Adverb.</p>

<p>No. 6. A Number.</p>

<p>No. 7. An Adjective.</p>

<p>No. 8. A Noun.</p>

<p>These having been written, the sentences
must then be read aloud:</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>No. 1 whispers the article The.</p>

<p>No. 2, the adjective Pink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>No. 3, the noun Hawthorn.</p>

<p>No. 4, the verb Plays.</p>

<p>No. 5, the adverb Prettily.</p>

<p>No. 6, the number Three hundred and
three.</p>

<p>No. 7, the adjective Fantastic.</p>

<p>No. 8, the noun Operas.</p>

<p>The sentence to be read, therefore, is,
The pink hawthorn plays prettily three hundred
and three fantastic operas.</p>

<p>The easiest way to draw will be to provide
several slips of paper, of exact size and
shape. Some of the papers must be blank,
others numbered, 1, 2, 3, and so on, making
nine in all. Put these papers on a tray and
pass to all in the room. The one drawing
the number 9 must be the reader, the other
numbers decide whether that individual
must whisper an article or an adjective, according
to the example given. Those having
blank papers do not play.</p>


<h3>SING, BIRDIE, SING.</h3>

<p>This game provokes laughter from the
most solemn individual. The company
should be seated in a ring. The one in
command enters the ring and makes much
ceremony in giving each player the name of
a bird; which may be, for example, heron,
kingfisher, bluebird, cat-bird, wood-thrush.
When each have been named, the commander
then whispers something to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
person. What he whispers is a motion or
sound or both, which he wishes the person to
give. When everybody has received their
cue, the commander steps to the centre of the
ring and calls, “One, two, three.” The moment
“Three” is spoken, each of the company
rise, and running round the circle of empty
chairs, flap their arms in imitation of wings,
sing or call as they have been directed.
The heron should make a motion as though
trying to get little fish out of holes in the
bottom of a pond, or he should stand on one
leg and appear to be asleep. The kingfisher
should brush up his hair, making it
rough on the top, and then act as if diving
for minnows. The bluebird should warble
a sweet song. The cat-bird should appear
full of fun and make melodious notes, but
he should also add the complaining <i>mee-aa;</i>
for the cat-bird is sometimes a wonderful
songster, but after nesting gives a sound
that is decidedly cat-like. The wood-thrush
should sing a most tender melody, and the
more melancholy the better. Hawks,
wood-peckers, chickadees, parrots, screech-owls,
ducks, geese and many other birds
might be added. The greater variety introduced
the better.</p>


<h3>SQUIRREL IN THE MIDDLE.</h3>

<p>This is a game for boys, and the player is
decided by lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The easiest way to arrange the lot is to
throw as many bits of paper, of similar size
and shape, into a hat as there are players.
All of these papers are blank excepting one,
this has the word “player” written on it.
The hat is then passed, and the boy drawing
the word “player” immediately sits on the
floor, the others stand in a circle around
him. Whoever is behind his back, pulls his
coat, or gently pulls his hair, taking him
unawares. He turns to catch this boy, but
while doing so another boy buffets him.
As the players dance about the circle, they
exclaim, “Squirrel in the middle catch him
if you can.”</p>

<p>Finally one of the boys is caught, and he
must then change places with the one he
has been tormenting.</p>


<h3>TABLESPOONS.</h3>

<p>Form a circle, one of the number going
into the ring. Present that person with a
tablespoon for each hand, and blindfold
him.</p>

<p>Then state that the others will skip around
him three times and then stop. As soon as
they stop, they will let go hands and stand
perfectly still. The party in the ring now
moves towards one of the players and must
tell who he is by touching him with the
spoons only. If his guess is correct, the
person caught now exchanges places with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the one in the ring; if he is incorrect, he
must try again.</p>

<p>This game is not as difficult as it at first
appears. Carefully notice the peculiarity
of clothing each one has on before you enter
the ring, whether, for instance, the frock
is trimmed, buttoned, etc., or the scarf is a
four-in-hand ornamented with a scarf-pin,
or if the scarf is run through a ring or tied in
a bow. Note also the wearing of the hair
and every detail that may occur to you, and
remember that the spoons may be used
whichever way one pleases. So, if they
touch beads, and there is only one person
who is wearing beads that will at once indicate
the individual; or if the spoon knocks
against a scarf pin and there is only one
boy wearing a scarf pin, he will of necessity
be recognized, and thus each player is
caught.</p>


<h3>THE EMPEROR’S COURT.</h3>

<p>Put a conspicuously handsome chair in
the centre of the room, also an ottoman for
the feet. On either side of this put as many
ordinary chairs as would accommodate the
players.</p>

<p>One of the company now goes to the
piano, and plays a march, all of the others,
rise, and, with considerable ceremony, escort
the tallest boy in the room to the chair of
honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>This boy now becomes an Emperor, and
the chair at his disposal, his throne, the rest
of the players his court. Immediately the
Emperor is seated, the music stops, and the
pianist together with the court seat themselves
also.</p>

<p>This game consists in copying the Emperor.
If he pretends to cry, the court must
cry, if he sings, the court must sing. The
Emperor should make himself as ridiculous
as is possible.</p>

<p>Or he might order one of the court to play
the piano and have a dance, or give a set of
military tactics.</p>

<p>Should any of the court laugh at a time
the Emperor is not laughing, he or she must
pay a forfeit.</p>


<h3>THREE LITTLE PIGS.</h3>

<p>This game is played after the same manner
as is Silhouettes, only those taking part
should be in costume, representing the words
they illustrate. It makes capital sport, and
nobody can fail to enjoy it, whether taking
part or not. The game is easily understood,
and is best described by an example.</p>

<p>One of the company should distinctly say,</p>

<div class="center">
Three little pigs went to market.</div>

<p class="unindent">When this is said, three pigs should appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
as if going to market, passing between a
candle and a white covered screen, they
should grotesquely walk, so adding to the
amusement. When these three have hobbled
off, the reader then recites,</p>

<div class="center">
Three little pigs stayed at home,</div>

<p class="unindent">which is likewise shown by three others of
the company; then in like manner,</p>

<div class="center">
Three little pigs have bread and butter,</div>

<p class="unindent">and so on through the rhyme, illustrating
every scene.</p>

<p>Paper will be found all the material necessary
to effect a disguise. Cut it in the form
of ears, etc., as is needed, and practise effects
before producing the game to amuse an
audience.</p>


<h3>THE FUNNY PRIMA DONNAS.</h3>

<p>Three girls should wear ridiculous costumes,
making themselves as grotesque as
possible. Each one being a prima donna,
should try to outdo the other in appearance
as also in voice. The hair should be fashioned
after the same arrangement as that of
a celebrated vocalist, the hands and arms
should be covered with evening gloves.
The material of the frock need not be costly,
but it should be smart and showy; the frock
should be made with a train. Each should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
carry a conspicuous fan, or immense bouquets
of large bright flowers, such as full-blown
roses, poppies, yellow chrysanthemums,
etc. The bouquets should be trimmed
elaborately around with white paper lace.</p>

<p>At an appropriate time the hostess will
announce the arrival of three celebrated
Prima Donnas, and before they appear she
will give each of the company a noticeably
colored paper flower, or bunch of flowers,
such as marigolds, morning glories, scarlet
geraniums. Having given the flowers, she
will say, “When the artists have concluded
their song, let each one do as I do.”</p>

<p>This said, the artists enter, and having
promenaded to the front room, gesticulating
all the time, they bow and sing a line each,
and each in a different key, to the tune of
“Auld Lang Syne,” the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Young Mousy Mouse</div>
<div class="verse">Has made a house</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the farmer’s cheese.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then in chorus,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And eats away</div>
<div class="verse">With friends each day,</div>
<div class="verse">As jolly as you please.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then separately the first three lines of the
second verse,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">But Mousy Mouse</div>
<div class="verse">Don’t see her house</div>
<div class="verse">Soon swallowed up must be.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>In chorus,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And with that house</div>
<div class="verse">Goes that poor mouse</div>
<div class="verse">As sure as sure can be.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The instant the last word is sung, the hostess,
with all her might and main, throws her
flower to reach the artist’s feet, and as the
company has been told to copy her, there
is a perfect rain of flowers. Afterwards they
are gathered, and divided between the
Prima Donnas, who triumphantly carry
them home as souvenirs of their charming
reception.</p>


<h3>DO YOU HEAR?</h3>

<p>This game needs two persons.</p>

<p>Stand at a distance from your confederate
who will ask, “Molly, do you hear?” and
who will keep up asking the question until
some one speaks. Then Molly says she
hears and leaves the room.</p>

<p>No sooner out, than her confederate will
explain to the company, “I shall hand some
one in this room a button, and I shall then
ask Molly to tell me who has it.” Having
thus explained, he hands the button to the
individual who spoke just before Molly left
the room. Then the confederate calls,
“Molly, who has the button?”</p>

<p>At once Molly replies correctly. The key<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
is very simple, being only to remember the
person who spoke as she left the room.</p>

<p>The game when played with a boy, should
have the word Johnny substituted for Molly.</p>


<h3>LAUGHABLE DINNER.</h3>

<p>Each girl in succession leads a boy to a
position to dance a reel.</p>

<p>First girl then says to first boy, “This is
my flower to decorate the table,” and she
gives him a flower which he puts in his
buttonhole.</p>

<p>Second girl to second boy, “This is my
flower to decorate the table,” and she gives
him a different flower, which he puts in his
buttonhole.</p>

<p>Third girl to third boy, “You tread clams
for dinner,” and the boy must make the
motion of treading clams.</p>

<p>Fourth girl to fourth boy, “You catch
trout for dinner,” and the boy makes believe
he is a fly-fisherman.</p>

<p>Fifth girl to fifth boy, “You get lamb to
roast,” and the boy calls, “Bah! bah!”</p>

<p>Sixth girl to sixth boy, “You get the turkey
to roast,” and the boy gives the call of
a turkey-gobbler.</p>

<p>Seventh girl to seventh boy, “You shoot
the duck for roasting,” and the boy calls,
“Quack! Quack!”</p>

<p>Eighth girl to eighth boy, “You are my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
pigeon to bake in a pie,” and the boy flaps
his arms in imitation of wings.</p>

<p>Ninth girl to ninth boy, “You are a baker
and must bake our cake,” and this boy pretends
to beat eggs.</p>

<p>Tenth girl to tenth boy, “You are the
young man who grinds good coffee,” and
he makes believe he is turning the crank of
a coffee-mill. As soon as the tenth boy responds,
a couple of good whistlers whistle
Yankee Doodle, all the others dance a reel,
repeating their calls and motions while
dancing.</p>


<h3>JOLLY PLAY.</h3>

<p>Arrange chairs in couples back to back,
placing them in different parts of the room,
and have one too few for your company.</p>

<p>All the players stand, one behind the
other, the one in charge at the head of the
line. He leads the party whichever way he
pleases. As they march, the leader sings to
the tune of, “There were Three Crows sat
on a Tree,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I must be gay</div>
<div class="verse">This merry day,</div>
<div class="verse">But game obey</div>
<div class="verse">I will, I will.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He may march about and sing this verse
as often as he wishes, but while singing, “I
will, I will,” he must some time fling himself
into a chair. As soon as the leader is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
seated, the others make a bold rush to follow
his example. The player for whom there is
no seat, now becomes leader, and the rest
of the company follow as before.</p>


<h3>THE DWARF.</h3>

<p>A boy should put his hands into small
stockings and shoes. Then put on a wig of
different color from his own hair. He must
fasten on a moustache, and put some black
sticking plaster over one or two of his front
teeth. His coat should be of a different
shape and his necktie should be of a different
style from that which he usually
wears. Indeed, he must be thoroughly
disguised. Back of him, another boy must
stand, and pass his arm around the first
boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Curtains must be drawn so that no part
of the second boy is seen but his arms.</p>

<p>Put a small table before them, and from
the back of this table drop a cloth, so as to
conceal the first boy below his waist. The
front boy puts his hands dressed in shoes
on the table, the boy back of him supplies
his arms and hands, and if properly arranged
a dwarf from three to four feet tall is thus
produced.</p>

<p>Of course, a tiny costume must be made.
Little Turkish trousers, a blouse-like coat, a
fez, a belt and small sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to have an exhibitor who should
tell some wonderful tale about the dwarf.
And the exhibitor should indicate that the
dwarf jokes, sings and dances, an exhibition
of which should then follow.</p>

<p>The dwarf should be fully prepared as to
what he will say and do. Several spicy
jokes should be at his tongue’s end. He
should gesticulate violently with his hands
and arms, and likewise sing the jolliest of
songs and dance the drollest dances.</p>

<p>It requires practice.</p>


<h3>CROWN GAME.</h3>

<p>A girl enters the ring; all the others take
firm hold of the rope. No sooner is she in
than they skip about her, keeping the rope
in motion. As they skip they sing, to the
tune of “Auld Lang-syne,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Who’ll crown our queen, our merry queen,</div>
<div class="verse">Who’ll crown our queen to-day?</div>
<div class="verse">Who’ll crown our queen, our merry queen,</div>
<div class="verse">Who’ll crown our queen to-day?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When this is sung, the children stop skipping
just where they are. And at once one
of the boys puts his head under the rope,
and, standing by the queen, replies, “I
will.” Then raising a crown of wild flowers,
he puts it on her head. No sooner is
she crowned than she blindfolds the boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and another girl enters, thus making two
girls in the ring. The game is to “tag” the
right girl before the other players count nine.
When the boy “tags” the girl, he must at
once say whether or not she is the queen,
and if he makes a mistake he must remain
in the ring and try again. The first girl
withdraws, the second girl is crowned queen,
and the game is repeated. But should he
make no mistake, the boy remains in the
ring, is crowned king, and the game goes
on, only that two boys are in the ring when
a girl is blindfolded.</p>


<h3>GUESS.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>A Rope Game.</i></p>

<p>Put a rope on the ground in the form of a
circle; in the centre put a stone about the
size of a duck’s egg. The players stand
backwards around the rope, with their heels
touching it. Each one in turn throws a
grace-hoop over his right shoulder, with the
hope it will encircle the stone. As soon as
the hoop is thrown all may turn and see the
position. If the hoop encircles the stone
the player may try again and again, until
he fails, counting one for each time. Then
the party to his right tries, and so on all
around the rope. Whoever has the largest
count wins the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>This game is also played facing the stone;
it is then no longer a game of guess, but a
game of skill.</p>


<h3>THE CIRCLE.</h3>

<p>On the floor or ground mark a circle, the
diameter of which is two feet.</p>

<p>The easiest way would be to use a hoople
of the correct size, and chalk it all around
close to the wood. Be careful not to move
the hoople while marking. Therefore, one
person would better hold the hoople, while
another uses the chalk.</p>

<p>Eight players are required, two and two
standing together, taking the same positions
as if they were to dance a quadrille. The
circle must be in the centre of the space
around which they stand, and the players
should be six feet from the outer edge.</p>

<p>In the circle place four small articles, three
without much value, and the other of some
little value. As an example, put in three
empty bottles, and one filled with inexpensive
perfume, or if you use flowers, put three
dandelions, and one half-blown rose. All
articles must be laid side by side, and as
nearly as possible, in the exact centre of the
circle.</p>

<p>When all is ready, the host, being at the
piano, should play “Pop Goes the Weasel,”
and if the game is played out of doors,
the same tune should be hummed or whistled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
When the music starts, the head
couples join hands and skip to the circle and
then back, this must be again and again
repeated, until the pianist suddenly stops.
Those who have been skipping must then
bow to each other wherever they happen to
be, also unclasp their hands, and neither
run nor walk, but skip as rapidly as possible
to the circle; sometimes they are fortunate
enough to be by it when the music stops;
then at once pick up one of the articles, and
skip back to the position held at the time
the game started.</p>

<p>These movements must be finished before
the musician again commences to play.
Then, holding the article in one hand and
your partner’s hand in the other, you skip
twice around the circle, and return to position.
The head couple leading, all the
others following after the same order, as the
march in a quadrille.</p>

<p>The articles are then put where they were
at the game’s start, and the side couples
repeat what the head couples have already
done.</p>

<p>The musician should allow enough time
to make it possible for all the players to pick
up an article, but he must not allow too
much time, or a prominent feature in the
game is missed.</p>

<p>Every one is desirous to pick up the valuable
article, but if you are not careful the
music will start before you have gotten anything:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in that case you must be blindfolded
and skip all alone four times around the circle.
While you are skipping, the spectators
are clapping. Whoever is fortunate enough
to have picked up the valuable article, may
retain it as a favor. This must therefore
have a duplicate, as the side couples have
equal chances with the heads.</p>


<h3>TWO SKIPPING-ROPE GAMES.</h3>

<p>Take a skipping-rope whenever you go
for a country frolic. One treat will be given
through clover blossoms. Each player
should gather enough of these sweet-scented
flowers to make three fair-sized bouquets,
when these are made, put them in a convenient
and cool place.</p>

<p>Take turns turning the rope; as soon as one
girl is through skipping, she should exchange
with one that has been turning. In that
way nobody is tired.</p>

<p>Enter the rope according to height, the
shortest player should go first. As soon as
the rope is in even motion, all the players
excepting the one to skip, should say, “One,
two, three,” the moment “Three” is said,
whoever is to skip must enter or lose her
turn. Should she trip before skipping eight
times she must give her successor a bouquet,
on the contrary, should she skip five times
without a break, her successor must present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
her with a bouquet. No one may be allowed
to skip more than fifteen times, as
too much rope skipping is injurious.</p>

<p>These rules must receive strict adherence.
When all have had opportunity to skip three
times, the game is finished. The winner
is the one who has received the most bouquets.</p>

<p>Another game requires ten players, two
turning and eight skipping. In this game
those who turn cannot be relieved, but must
turn until the game is concluded.</p>

<p>This time the tallest player is the first to
enter, the others stand according to height,
one directly back of the other. As soon as
the rope is in steady motion, the first player
starts, skips once, runs out and around to a
rock or tree previously decided on, where
she is safe, the second immediately enters
the rope, after the first one runs out, the
point being for the second one to tag the
first before she can reach her destination.
The third player, however, enters the rope as
the second has run out, and is trying just as
hard to tag the second, as the second is to
tag the first, and so on, each rapidly following
the one before, and thus this game keeps
steadily on until all have been through the
rope three times.</p>

<p>Whoever has been tagged is out of the
game, and can no longer play; this decides
who are the winners.</p>

<p>It now becomes the duty of all who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
played, to gather quantities of clover or other
field blossoms, enough to trim the rope from
one end to the other. In this form the pretty
flowers are taken home, and used for dining-room
decoration. Festoon the mantel,
or wind it around the chandelier, allowing
the ends to drop low towards the table.</p>

<p>As only one person can have this rope of
flowers, decide which one, by counting out.</p>


<h3>RUNNING FOR THE CAP.</h3>

<p>The boys must be equally divided; one
set is called catchers, the other runners, and
these sets must stand fifty yards apart. The
catcher’s position is thirty yards from the
post, and the runners’ twenty. The call,
one, two, three, is given, and on the second
three is spoken one boy from each party
runs to the post. The runner will naturally
get there first, and he has to put the cap on
his head, and then replace it. He must do
this with the utmost rapidity, as, should the
catcher overtake him on his way back to the
position which he held before starting to run,
the boy becomes the catcher’s prisoner, and
can no longer play.</p>


<h3>FIRE-ARCH DISCOUNT GAME.</h3>

<p>A strip of wood two inches thick, five
inches wide, and one yard long will be required.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
In this cut five arches, making the
centre one four inches in width, the others
three inches each; stand it up on the floor
or on a table, and make the starting-point
six feet away. Four marbles may be rolled
by each player. When a marble goes
through the centre arch it counts sixty, but
if, instead, it goes through either of the small
arches, thirty is counted off. If a marble
fails to pass through either, it is counted out
of the game, and must be removed. The
next turn around, the player will use only
three instead of four marbles. The boy who
has the highest tally has won; should there
be a tie, they must roll again.</p>

<p>This game requires practice, or some
players will find that they have lost more
than they have made.</p>


<h3>THE BAGATELLE BOARD COUNT GAME.</h3>

<p>Chalk a floor or mark a space in exact
copy of a bagatelle-board ten feet long by
three wide. In the inclosure, at correct distances,
mark the numbers; this may be done
with chalk, or the numbers may be painted
on thin wooden blocks and laid in position.
Each player must start his marble at the
extreme left-hand corner, and state before
starting the number he wishes to roll to.
Should the marble go to that number, and
not roll on so as to touch another, the player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
counts the number selected, and can then
state another number and play for that, and
can so continue for seven minutes, provided
his marble always hits the number selected,
and though rolling on, does not touch or
stop at any other. When his time is up his
count is scored, and the next player follows,
subject to the same rules. Should the
marble stop on the number selected, it is
counted double in favor of the player.
Again, should the marble, having reached
the selected number, still roll on and touch
another, no count is allowed, and the player
must stop until his turn comes again.</p>


<h3>FUNNY QUESTIONS WITH FUNNY ANSWERS.</h3>

<p>All the players stand in a circle and join
hands.</p>

<p>The tallest one in the room whispers a
question to her right-hand neighbor, who
answers her in a whisper, and then turns
and asks <i>her</i> right-hand neighbor a question,
who replies in like manner. When questions
and answers have all gone around, the
party who commenced states aloud the
question her <i>left</i>-hand neighbor asked, and
the reply her <i>right</i>-hand neighbor gave.</p>

<p>Example: Suppose three players.</p>

<p>First questions.</p>

<p>Second answers, then turns and ask third.</p>

<p>Third answers, and asks the first, who answers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, questions and answers having gone
all around, first says aloud, “My left-hand
neighbor asked, and my right-hand neighbor
answered.”</p>

<p>First Player: What is the brightest idea
this season?</p>

<p>Second Player: Your eye, dear (idea).</p>

<p>How many blackbirds were baked in the
pie?</p>

<p>Third Player: Four-and-twenty. What
was the name of Goliath of Gath’s grandmother’s
straw bonnet maker?</p>

<p>First Player: Nobody knows.</p>

<p>When all have played.</p>

<p>First Player, aloud: The question asked
me was, “What was the name of Goliath of
Gath’s grandmother’s straw bonnet maker?”
the answer was, “Your eye, dear (idea).”</p>

<p>Second Player: The question asked me
was, “What is the brightest idea this
season?” The answer was, “Four-and-twenty!”</p>

<p>Third Player: The question asked was,
“How many blackbirds were baked in
the pie?” The answer was, “Nobody
knows.”</p>

<p>The one whose question has been most
appropriately answered aloud, must be entertained
by the others, as he desires—by
dancing, playing a favorite game, by music,
recitations or any other suggested amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h3>JUDGE AND JURY.</h3>

<p>Draw lots for a Judge and five Jurymen.
Pass six numbered paper slips in a fancy
bag. Whoever draws number one is Judge,
and the others the Jury. All the other
players take the name of a celebrated musician
or composer, as Beethoven, De Pachmann,
or Schubert, etc.</p>

<p>The Judge now takes a seat at one end of
the room. The Jurymen sit at one side in
a row, and the rest of the people sit at a
distance. The Judge calls one of the other
players up to the bar and proceeds to question
him or her. The <i>prisoner</i> is bound to
answer any question the Judge may see fit
to ask, and the business of the Jury is to
decide the name of the musician the prisoner
has assumed.</p>

<p>Ten questions are all that may be asked.
At the end of those the prisoner seats himself
and awaits the Jury’s verdict. If the
first decision of the Jury is incorrect, the
prisoner is released. But if correct, the
prisoner takes the place of one of the Jurymen,
who must draw to determine which
one is relieved. The ex-Juryman then takes
his place among the waiting prisoners and
assumes a character.</p>

<p>After three trials the Judge must be a
Juryman, and one of them must take his
place. This, too, is decided by lot.</p>

<p>By so doing all are on duty all the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and the end of the game is when the players
are tired.</p>


<h3>THE CARD INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>When young people are not very well acquainted,
play this game, and by the time
that it is finished every one will think he
must have known everybody else for the
last seven years.</p>

<p>Place chairs so as to form a ring, and ask
your friends to be seated. Then have a pack
of say, authors’ cards in your hand, state
that every one must say what you say, and
give what you give to his left-hand neighbor.
Then lifting up the top card in the
pack, you say to your guest at your left,
“Here’s my card, Longfellow.” The one
who receives it instantly turns to the party
at his left and, giving the card, repeats
the same words, “Here’s my card, Longfellow.”
The next card follows at once in
the same manner, repeating whatever its
portrait, may be, and so card follows
card without a second’s delay, and the
laughter and fun that is made causes even
the dullest person in the room to wake up
and be hale fellow for the next entertainment.
Should any card drop, let it go.
There will not be enough time to pick it up
until the game is ended.</p>

<h3>HARMONY SOLOISTS.</h3>

<p>One of the young men must represent the
Lord of Misrule, and in fantastic attire he
goes from one to the other of the guests and
asks each to draw one slip of paper from the
basket which he carries.</p>

<p>On each slip are written four lines of any
popular or well-known song. Each slip
contains a different song.</p>

<p>As soon as the papers are drawn five of
the people stand up in a line, and with the
Lord of Misrule as director they each sing
separately their particular four lines to the
correct tune. When each of the five have
sung, all sing together as chorus, each carefully
keeping his own words and music.</p>

<p>Then another five, and then another, until
all have sung. Then for a grand finale, all
the guests stand as chorus and in duets,
trios, quartettes sing the one stanza through,
all joining in the refrain each time.</p>

<p>The harmony will be remarkable.</p>


<h3>JIG-I-TY JIG.</h3>

<p>Chairs are placed to form a circle, and all
the players excepting two occupy the chairs.</p>

<p>One of the two players must play a polka
or waltz. The other one stands outside of
the circle.</p>

<p>The one standing outside dances as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as the music starts, and continues dancing
as long as she pleases, but all of a sudden
she stops a second before a chair, and then
dances up to the chair. Whoever occupies
it instantly rises and dances back to her,
and after a while the first dancer waves a
backward movement of the hand toward
her friend, thus indicating she is not wanted
to continue dancing. But she must walk or
waltz back to her chair and then sit down.</p>

<p>The first dancer continues dancing, however,
and goes to another party in precisely
the same way as she did to the first, and
when she concludes she has the right one,
she dances to that party’s seat and takes it.</p>

<p>The individual then on the floor continues
dancing, as did the first one. When she sits
down a third party dances, and so on until
all have danced.</p>

<p>If any of the company do not dance, they
should make a feint of doing so. If the
individual is full of fun, much amusement
is created.</p>


<h3>CIRCLE GAME.</h3>

<p>Make a target of brown wrapping-paper,
and put the number 100 on the bull’s eye.
Outside of this mark five rings, making the
largest one two feet in diameter, the others
proportionately smaller. Inside of these
rings put the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, the
centre as stated being 100. Mark out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
space on the ground for a base five feet
away; place the target on the ground,
blindfold a player, lead him to the base,
and turn him around twice, and leave him
facing the target. He is now entitled to roll
three marbles, and then remove the blindfold.
His count will be the added numbers
in the rings at which his marbles have
stopped. Should any of them stop on a
line, he is entitled to the largest number
adjoining. No marbles must be moved,
and each boy has the privilege of trying the
ground once with each marble, before being
blindfolded.</p>


<h3>THE HUNT FOR THE KEYHOLE.</h3>

<p>A tall boy should put on the skirt of a
lady’s dress. This skirt should just escape
the floor. In his hands he should carry
a broom, with the broom end held directly
above him, and the broom handle held
close in front of him.</p>

<p>A ball to simulate a person’s head should
be secured by strong twine to the broom.
This ball should have a false face securely
fastened to the front of it, while, as a cover
for the rest of the ball there should be a
lady’s bonnet. This bonnet cannot be too
grotesquely trimmed. Long plumes, brilliant
flowers, natural or artificial, sunflowers,
hollyhocks, cucumber blossoms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
etc., would be correct decoration. The bonnet
should be tied underneath the false face,
being careful to have the bow ends voluminous
and the streamers long. The ribbon
should be vivid scarlet, or bright orange
color.</p>

<p>Just below the bonnet and around the
broom fasten a cloak, the bottom of which
should reach beyond the boys waist; in this
way the boy and the broom are entirely concealed.</p>

<p>The company should be asked to take
seats at the rear end of the room, then announce
that they are to be entertained by
the pantomime entitled “The Hunt for the
Keyhole.”</p>

<p>Then the door should be opened, and at
once a tall, odd-looking individual enters.
His appearance creates roars of laughter, as
also his ridiculous actions when having
bowed to the audience he turns to the door
through which he has come and commences
his search. The effect is ridiculous, as the
head is bobbed around in every direction
whichever way the boy chooses to turn, as
also whichever way he chooses to move the
broom. When enough amusement has been
gotten, the boy again bows and comically
waltzes out of the room.</p>

<p>The boy will need an assistant to dress,
and this game should be privately practised
before showing it to an audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>


<h3>ACTING PROVERBS</h3>

<p>This is played by one of the party leaving
the room, and on his return acting in such a
manner as to indicate to the others a well-known
proverb. Example, “A rolling stone
gathers no moss,” may be indicated by the
one having left the room returning with a
round stone in his hand and rolling it on the
floor.</p>


<h3>GOSSIP.</h3>

<p>This title suggests an amusing <i>tableau
vivant</i> for an evening at home.</p>

<p>Two girls should withdraw and put over
their pretty dresses queer-looking old shawls,
and cover their curls with odd-looking bonnets
tied under the chin.</p>

<p>They should sit very close together, and
with cups of tea in their hands gaze intently
at each other, busily stirring the while.
They must nod their heads as though one
were telling a bit of scandal.</p>

<p>Suddenly one exclaims in a high-pitched
voice, “You don’t say so!” whereupon the
hostess should inquire, “Who can tell what
these girls represent?”</p>

<p>A number of the company will naturally
reply, “Gossip.”</p>


<h3>THE FLORIST.</h3>

<p>Whoever assumes this character should
explain that he has flowers for sale, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
he will try and sell all that he has by putting
questions to the persons whom he
thinks will buy, and that whoever in answering
his questions uses the words <i>flowers</i>, <i>yes</i>,
or <i>no</i> would have to pay a forfeit, and that
he will try all that he can to get them to use
one of the prohibited words.</p>

<p>Then the Florist should turn to one of the
players and ask, “Can I sell you any fresh
flowers to-day?”</p>

<p>“I am fully supplied, thank you.” And
addressing another, “Do buy my sweet
violets.”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, sir.”</p>

<p>“How about carnations?”</p>

<p>“I don’t wish flowers of any kind.”</p>

<p>And in that way a forfeit is incurred.</p>

<p>The questions should be rapidly asked,
and as rapidly answered, or the players will
not get caught.</p>


<h3>MY LADY’S RECEPTION APPAREL.</h3>

<p>One of the players should act the part of
lady’s maid. Each of the players should
take the name of something which a lady
would wear to a reception, as an article of
clothing or jewelry. Or a player may take
the name of an article a lady would use in
getting ready for a reception, as a comb and
brush.</p>

<p>The lady’s maid should stand at one end
of the room, and looking towards the players<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
announce, “My lady is going to a reception
to-night, and wishes a handkerchief,”
or whatever article she may choose
to select. The one named instantly rises,
and steps two feet forward, makes a low
bow, then suddenly starting up twists
about, and turning to her right-hand neighbor
says, “Change chairs.”</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. Everybody
on the instant rushes for a chair, including
the lady’s maid, and the one that is left
without a chair becomes the next lady’s
maid.</p>

<p>This person may continue the game, as
did the previous maid, or she may say,
“My lady is going to a reception to-night
and wants her salts.”</p>

<p>The moment salts are desired some of the
players must sneeze as if the salts were too
strong, others should appear to faint, and
others wave their hands forward and back
as if fanning.</p>

<p>Any second that the lady’s maid may
choose she may exclaim, “Change chairs!”
and again there is another scramble, with
one person left without, and there is therefore
a new lady’s maid.</p>

<p>This maid may try yet another way, which
will result in getting almost all of the players
on their feet before they can change
chairs. She asks the players to re-name
themselves, and for nearly all of them to
select articles of apparel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the maid says, for instance, “My
lady desires her white ivory fan.”</p>

<p>The person so named should rise, go two
feet forward and, having bowed very low,
should stand just where she is until the
signal for change chairs is given.</p>

<p>The maid might then say, “My lady
desires her white satin gown.” The person
named white satin gown rises, and repeats
the action of the one going before. And thus
the maid continues to call, until having all
the requisite articles of apparel. But when
she exclaims, “My lady wishes her white
kid shoes!” all rush for a seat.</p>

<p>Whoever is left without a chair after this
method of playing must rapidly tell the bootblack
story.</p>

<p>“As I was going down the street I saw
two bootblacks. One was a black bootblack
and the other a white bootblack, and both
had black boots, as well as blacking and
blacking brushes. The black bootblack
asked the white bootblack to black his, the
black bootblack’s black boot with blacking.
The white bootblack consented to black
the black boots of the black bootblack with
blacking, but when he, the white bootblack
had blacked one black boot of the black bootblack
with blacking, he the white bootblack
refused to black his, the black bootblack’s,
other black boot with blacking unless he,
the black bootblack, paid him, the white
bootblack, the same as what he, the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
bootblack, got for blacking other people’s
black boots; whereupon, the black bootblack
grew still blacker in the face, and called the
white bootblack a blackguard, at the same
time hitting the white bootblack with the
black boot that he, the white bootblack, had
already blacked with blacking.”</p>

<p>Should any one not leave his chair he must
pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>Should the maid ask for an article that has
not been taken for a name, she must pay a
forfeit.</p>


<h3>THIMBLE GAME.</h3>

<p>In order to be enjoyable this game requires
several players, and it is better that
they should be both boys and girls, as it then
has the added element of a match between
the boys and girls.</p>

<p>Put a silver or gold thimble in full view,
in any convenient room, into which your
friends have not yet entered. It makes the
game more difficult if this room is well filled
with <i>bric-à-brac</i>, hangings, pictures, plants,
etc., for the reason that the eye is confused
with so much ornament and therefore cannot
so easily detect such a small thing as a
thimble.</p>

<p>State clearly the following directions before
your friends enter. No one can touch
anything. Each player must stand until he
sees the thimble. Every one may walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
about as much as he pleases, but talking is
prohibited. Having seen the thimble, immediately
sit down. It is a point of honor
that no player will give information. When
all are seated the game is finished.</p>

<p>Of course the girls want to get ahead of
the boys, and the boys ahead of the girls,
in locating the thimble. Therefore if a
boy sits down first, the girls are sorry;
and if a boy sits down last, the boys are
sorry.</p>

<p>The one who first sits down is the one to
receive honor, and he has the privilege of
selecting the next game as well as deciding
on the forfeit to be given by the boy or girl
who has been the last to sit down. Sometimes
the hostess gives the thimble to the
one winning the game.</p>

<p>Players must be very cautious, or their
eyes will tell what their tongues would not;
therefore, having seen the thimble, at once
glance in another direction, and you will
thus mystify where you would otherwise
assist.</p>


<h3>THE TOUCH GAME.</h3>

<p>This requires an assistant to whom the
secret of the game is intrusted. The assistant
leaves the room, the other party remains
with the company, and states that during the
assistant’s absence she will put her hand on
some object, person, or thing, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
assistant returns he will tell what has been
touched.</p>

<p>The assistant now being out, the piano
stool is touched. On the assistant’s return
he is asked, “What did I touch?” at once
he replies, “The piano stool.”</p>

<p>Of course this causes great surprise and
the assistant is asked to go out again, the
company expecting, perhaps, to be able to
guess this time. For a change a girl is
touched, and on the assistant’s return he
is asked, “Whom did I touch?” and he
promptly says, “Bessie Brown,” or whatever
the girl’s name.</p>

<p>Then the players think there must be some
look or gesture given to aid the assistant
when he re-enters, and so they are given the
privilege of blindfolding him before his return,
but all in vain, the assistant is as correct
as before and no one is able to guess.</p>

<p>Then the company beg: “Do tell us the
secret.” So when all give up they are told
that just before the assistant leaves the room,
the other player secretly touches some person
or thing, or perhaps indicates what the
object is with his foot or perhaps sits on it,
if it be a chair or stool. Occasionally, to
further mystify, it would be well to simply
fold one’s arms. This would signify to the
confederate, “I am touching myself.”
Therefore the assistant, whether blindfolded
or not, can answer correctly, because he
has received his clue before he went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, this game requires an intelligent
assistant; indeed, both players must
be very careful, as so many eyes are on the
constant lookout.</p>

<p>This will be found a satisfactory game
for a rainy afternoon in a summer hotel,
when the grown people are taking naps and
there seems absolutely nothing left for
young people to do, and they are tired
watching the weather, and saying, “If it
would <i>only</i> clear!”</p>


<h3>THE CONCERT.</h3>

<p>Select a conductor. All others sit before
him in a semicircle, and each is given an
imaginary musical instrument.</p>

<p>The conductor next directs them to tune
their instruments, after which, taking a cane
he waves it, as if it were a baton. He also
whistles or hums a gay, familiar air. In this
all join, imitating by voice and gesture the
instruments they are supposed to be playing
on, such as the flute, the harp, the hand-organ,
the cymbals, violin, cornet, etc.</p>

<p>Suddenly he waves his baton and the
music ceases.</p>

<p>The conductor then calls for solos. All
the musicians give close attention, and the
conductor makes believe he is playing, thus
indicating which instrument he wishes to
hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The player having that instrument must
at once obey, imitating both sound and
gestures. Should he fail, he must pay a
forfeit.</p>


<h3>A CURIOUS CAT.</h3>

<p>This is a trick to be played only where
the people know each other very well.</p>

<p>A tall screen is required, a cat, a saucer
of milk, a table and a showman.</p>

<p>The showman is the most important, for
on his ready wit and tactful manner the
success of the trick depends.</p>

<p>He stands by the screen and says to the
audience,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Come behind this screen and you will see</div>
<div class="verse">A cat with her head where her tail ought to be.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One by one, the guests may go, and each
must observe a discreet silence, so that the
rest may not guess what the trick is.</p>

<p>As each goes behind the screen, a table is
seen on which is a cat with her tail towards
a saucer of milk, where, were it not for the
showman’s efforts, her head would naturally
be. This foolish trick will always cause a
hearty laugh.</p>


<h3>A BOAT RACE.</h3>

<p>Girls who do not care to row should act
as umpires. A grand stand may be a massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
rock ornamented with a tangle of vines
and for a canopy a wide-branched tree.</p>

<p>There should be three races, one between
the girls, another between the boys, and a
third between the girls and boys together.
Two large willows or other trees, conspicuously
overhanging the water, and therefore
impossible to mistake, should be selected
as the points to start and end the race, the
prow of the boat should be even with the
centre of the tree trunk at starting, and the
stern of the boat should be even with the
centre of the tree trunk on closing. Only
one person should be in the boat at a time,
and no person can have a second chance.</p>

<p>As the water is frequently too narrow for
all boats to be out at once, it is wiser to try
two boats at a time, and then two more
should row and so on. After the race is
over the victors must row again, two and
two, as at the first, and so determine the
winners. When the winning girl and the
winning boy are known, they should
race together, and thus the champion rower
will be discovered. Whoever is champion
should be rewarded with a wreath of laurel,
after the fashion of the great Roman victors;
if laurel cannot be found, use oak leaves
and tell the hero they are meant for laurel.
The wreath must be made and at the grand
stand before the race opens. The coronation
should take place at the stand.</p>

<p>While gathering the leaves for the crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
it would prove a pleasure to gather quantities
of wild flowers, with which to decorate the
boats. A simple and pretty trimming would
be to carpet the boat with moss and edge
it around with fern leaves. Another way
would be to canopy a boat with apple
blossoms; the branches are easily held in
place between the narrow strip of wood
that forms the border, and the boat itself.
But a canopy retards motion, and the rowers
must consider speed before they decide on
decoration.</p>


<h3>THREE LITTLE MAIDS FROM SCHOOL.</h3>

<p>Three tall boys should dress as prima
donnas, carry bouquets, and sing the popular
song, “Three Little Maids from School
are we.”</p>

<p>After this they should appear as giants
and perform a variety of tricks.</p>

<p>For example: Hold an umbrella over
their heads, which is covered with a long
cloak. To the top of the umbrella-stick
fasten a ball the size of a person’s head,
on to this ball put a round hat, and a veil so
as to conceal the face. Thus the boys will
be of gigantic size, and their very appearance
will provoke laughter.</p>

<p>After bowing to their friends, they should
dance a few reel figures, then walk about
the room and examine the chandeliers, tops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the pictures or frescoing. Then play
“Puss in the corner.” When they repeat
“Puss, Puss, Puss,” they should use unnatural
tones.</p>

<p>It is very funny, and those who are not
“little maids” will have almost as much
sport as if they were.</p>


<h3>THE WAR OF THE ROSES.</h3>

<p>This is a pretty, interesting and instructive
game, as those engaged in it and not
familiar with the period of history to which
it refers may be led to study it, and the
knowledge received through playing may
thus prove beneficial.</p>

<p>It is particularly suited to out-of-door
amusement, though it may be played indoors
by making a field of battle. This
could be done by putting a rug in the centre
of a room, and stating, that rug represents
the battlefield of Saint Albans, or the battle-field
of Towton, or you may have both
battles, should you so prefer.</p>

<p>When played out of doors, mark out a
piece of lawn in the same way that a tennis
court is marked. Or, should there be no
lawn, mark an oblong on the ground by
means of a sharp-pointed stick.</p>

<p>The battle-field should be five feet one
way, and three the other.</p>

<p>Choose two of the largest boys for leaders;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
one of them will personate Richard the
Duke of York, the other the nearest relative
of the house of Lancaster, who was the
Duke of Somerset.</p>

<p>Then in turn, commencing with the Duke
of York, the boys will call their soldiers,
which may be (as this is a game) girls as
well as boys. As each one’s name is called,
he stands in line on the side of his leader.
When all are chosen, the Duke of York
gives his soldiers, as also himself, the
symbol of the Yorkists, which was a white
rose, and in like manner the Lancastrians
receive their symbol, which was a red
one.</p>

<p>Commencing at the foot of the line, the
Duke of York will blindfold his soldier, and
lead him around for one minute, thus confusing
him as to location; but when he stops
leading him, he must be six feet from the
battlefield, and his face so turned as to
make it possible to reach it. Then the
leader calls one, two, three, and at once the
soldier throws his rose. The blindfold is
then removed, and he will see how near the
field his charge has reached.</p>

<p>It is now the turn of the house of Lancaster,
and the Duke of Somerset will blindfold
the soldier at the end of his line, and
thus the game proceeds as before. When
every one has played, the roses on the battlefield
are counted. Whichever side has on
the most roses has won. Then all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
roses are picked up and presented to the
victors by the losing side. Each one of the
winners then adorns himself with a red and
white rose.</p>

<p>No rose can be counted on the battlefield,
unless every part of it is on, including the
stem and foliage.</p>

<p>There must be an even number of players.</p>


<h3>UNBAR.</h3>

<p>Every player excepting the boy known
as Bear, must twist and knot his handkerchief.
The Bear selects a tree as a starting
point, and states his object will be to tag
the others. Whoever is tagged becomes a
Bear, and must return to the tree, pursued
and beaten all the way back with the knotted
handkerchiefs. The two Bears then
join hands, and, starting out, try to tag every
one that is possible, and this action is repeated
until all the players are Bears.
Whenever the chain of Bears is broken, as
it sometimes is by an attack from the rear,
the Bears again return to the tree.</p>


<h3>BIRD TEST.</h3>

<p>Give each player a slip of paper on which
he must write the birds’ names. Also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
number of times the word bird and birds’
names occur.</p>

<p>The correct number to find is seventy-six.</p>

<p>Time allowed is six minutes.</p>

<p>The slip should be headed Bird Test.</p>

<p>One day while walking along a grassy
lane conspicuously edged with blackberry
bushes, my attention was riveted by the
song of a bird, a sort of up and down warble,
and in the branches of a maple tree
near, I saw a red-eyed viero, and not far off,
quietly looking towards the singer, was
such a pretty warbler, another greenlet, the
white-eyed viero.</p>

<p>Listening to the red-eye, the viero’s warble
grew less and less distinct as the distance
lengthened between us. The warbler
warbled the same sweet song, but my ear
was less able to catch the warbling warbler’s
notes, and soon the greenlet, the viero, the
musical, silver-tongued warbler, warbled for
me all in vain.</p>

<p>But as I walked I thought how rarely that
we meet people who are indifferent to birds,
and how desolate our lanes, woods and gardens
would be without them. And how
much beauty is added to bushes, flowers, and
trees, if a singing bird rests on them long
enough for us to listen to his song. And
then I named over some favorite birds. The
meadow lark, blue jay, Carolina wren, wood
thrush, robin, swallow. But suddenly I
heard “Me-au, me-au,” as if a cat was near.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
I stood just where I was, to discover the
creature. My thought of birds gave a
thought of protection. A moment later and
I laughed aloud, for flying over my head was
the jolly song-bird, called cat-bird, who has
a bad habit of mewing. But the sunshine
seemed pleasant company for him; for
watching the cat-bird’s movements I saw
him alight on a tree close by, and with a
hop and a skip go from limb to limb.</p>

<p>Whip-poor-will, whip-poor-will, and again
on the alert, my eyes were almost strained,
this time in effort to follow the sad cry, looking
everywhere for whip-poor-will. When
what a pleasant surprise, to learn that whip-poor-will
was none other than the brilliantly
colored mocking bird, whose fancy had dictated
the whip-poor-will’s melancholy notes
and now whizzed close to me, to nestle on
the blackberry blossoms a few steps beyond.</p>

<p>Then walking on I thought of the many
birds about us, the brown thrasher, and
white-throated sparrow, the tree sparrow,
the bank and barn swallows, and the sociable
sparrow, dear little chippy, and of what
I had read about fly-catchers and veerys,
and the crested titmouse who gleefully
shouts in the wildest winds, “T’ sweet
here! t’ sweet here!”</p>

<p>My walk by this time was hurried into a
run, and I caught my foot into some poor
bird’s nest that was hidden in the long grass,
and I almost fell, but being glad I had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
tripped over a rut-runner, I thought of the
quotation, “Runs like the kill-deer up the
rut,” and a warbler near sang so cheerily that
I forgot my accident and soon reached the
creek towards which I was hastening.
When who should come first to greet me but
a yellow-billed cuckoo. And thus my mind
dwelt on other birds that liked creeks and
lakes, such as the kingfisher, and on the instant
I heard the report of a gun, and sure
enough one of these birds had just been shot.
I knew this because of the excitement of a
group of gunners.</p>

<p>Poor bird! How many birds’ lives end in
a similar way. The cardinal grosbeak and
the myrtle bird, a greenlet in color, we
fancy myrtle suggests greenlet, the snow-buntings,
horned larks, golden-crowned
kinglet and vesper sparrows, the red-polls
and crossbills, the plovers, the golden
herons, night-herons, sandpipers, coots,
hawks, geese, and swans,—all are marks for
the hunter.</p>

<p>And then I thought, Oh, if I could fly over
this clapper-rail ahead of me! It is so very
stupid to keep my feet on the earth. How
jolly to flap my wings to the Lapland long-spur.
I would visit the raven and all
the rest of the feathered family on the
way.</p>

<p>But my walk had ended and such a pretty
warbler warmly welcomed me home,—my
golden-hued, night-singing canary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h3>“IT.”</h3>

<p>Many of the games with which we are
familiar in the United States are well known
throughout Great Britain and on the Continent.
But among the most amusing and
most popular of English games is one of
which we know little or nothing. It is dignified
by the two-lettered name, “It.”</p>

<p>This is altogether suitable for the parlor,
and may be played by everybody if we will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
except the very young people. It creates
roars of laughter, on account of the funny
mistakes made by the questioners. “It”
is a great mystery, and the longer it is played
the greater mystery often it becomes. Only
those understanding this game may remain
in the room. All others must leave; there
is no alternative. One of the party, unfamiliar
with the game, is then selected to
return, and must, by questioning those in
the parlor, learn what “it” is. When he
knows “it,” he too must remain behind,
and some one else is selected to fill his
place. In this way the game is carried on,
until each one in turn comes in and finds out
the secret.</p>

<p>“It” is really the person who sits at your
left, but, before this is discovered, usually
much amusement is made. The game is
played in the following way:</p>

<p>All in the parlor must sit in a circle, and
must not change their positions. When the
player is called in, he is told to ask a question
of whomsoever he may please, and the
person must correctly answer. For example—“Is
‘it’ white?” As everybody
present is white, the answer is necessarily
“Yes.”</p>

<p>The questioner then asks another person.
“Is ‘it’ thin?” and if the person thus questioned
is thin, the answer is again, “Yes.”
Perhaps this question may be repeated, and
some one else is asked, “Do you also think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
‘it’ is thin?” and if this person has someone
for a left-hand neighbor who is very
stout, of course he answers, “No.”</p>

<p>And thus the questioner is mystified, and
must continue question after question. For
a long time he may think “it” is a thing.
Therefore a good question to put would be,
“Is ‘it’ alive?” And then he might ask,
“Is ‘it’ in this room?” Then he might try
complexion, and again would be mystified,
for if he asked, “Is ‘it’ a brunette?” and
the reply being “Yes,” his next question,
“Has ‘it’ dark eyes?” would perhaps have
for answer, “No,” and, “Has ‘it’ light
hair?” “Yes.” And so the secret seems
harder than ever.</p>

<p>A good way is to ask the same questions
over and over, and try to locate “it” in that
way. But the questioner should not easily
be discouraged. A few points may be given
to him, such as some of the above. The
players would better announce “It” as a
trick game.</p>


<h3>THE CENT HUNT.</h3>

<p>Say that a cent is wrapped in tissue-paper
and is within sight. The discoverer quietly
tells you, and if he is correct, reward
him.</p>

<p>Afterwards give a cent, pencil and paper
to everybody, and state five minutes are allowed
to write what each side of the cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
will tell. This game is called, A Penny for
your Thoughts.</p>

<p>“Find on one side: A beverage—T. A
messenger—one c(s)ent. A piece of armor—shield.
A symbol of victory—wreath. A
weapon—arrow. A mode of punishment—stripes.
A gallant—bow. A sheet of water—C.</p>

<p>“Find on the other side: A portion of a
hill—brow. A place of worship—temple.
An animal—hare. Youth and old age—18—96.
One way of expressing marriage—U. S.
A cultivated flower—tulip. An emblem of
royalty—crown. Fruit—date.”</p>


<h3>A FAGOT PARTY.</h3>

<p>This is a very entertaining amusement
and suitable for all ages.</p>

<p>As the word fagot means a bundle of
twigs, it suggests an open fire. Therefore
home and hearth are indispensable environment.</p>

<p>There should be just as many twigs as
there are girls and boys. The idea being
that each should draw a twig from the bundle
as his name is called. And they are
called by the hostess according to the letters
of the alphabet. Whosever name therefore
commences with A, should draw the first
twig. Having drawn the twig, A puts it on
the open fire and at once commences to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
a story. As long as the twig lasts, A must
continue to talk, but when it is burned he
must stop, and as twigs are apt to burn
very rapidly when toward the end, the story
is not infrequently wound up in a jiffy. As
soon as A has finished, the next name is
called and that person does exactly as did
the first one, only he must tell a different
story. And so on until everybody has taken
his turn.</p>


<h3>THE HUNTER.</h3>

<p>This very lively game is played by both
boys and girls, and the more, of course, the
merrier. The hunter must be a boy, and to
decide which boy, it is best to count out.
Use for counting the old rhyme,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Ana, mana, mona, mike,</div>
<div class="verse">Bassa, lona, bona, strike,</div>
<div class="verse">Hare, ware, frown, stack,</div>
<div class="verse">Halloka, balloka, wee, woe, why, whack.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whoever is fortunate enough to have the
word “whack” counted to him is out, and
then the rhyme must be repeated over and
over, and finally the hunter is left. It now
becomes his duty to name the rest of the
company as his equipments as sportsman,
and also as his game; for example, pointer,
setter—two species of hunting dogs—and
shot, belt, powder, gun, powder-flask, rifle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
cartridge, rabbit, squirrel, partridge, kingfisher,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>Put two rows of chairs back to back.
There should be one chair less than there
are players. This done, each one of the
company except the hunter takes a chair.
The hunter, standing before the rest of the
players, then sings, to the tune of “I Love
a Sixpence,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">I am a hunter, a jolly, jolly hunter;</div>
<div class="verse">I love hunting as I love my life.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">This he may sing over as many times as he
likes, but finally stops short in the middle or
anywhere, and immediately calls out a name—for
instance, “Shot.” The person bearing
this name must at once rise, and hurrying
towards the hunter, must take hold of the
back of his coat or jacket. Then the hunter
continues his song, and calls for each one,
until all are behind him, each holding firmly
to the one in front. When all are in place,
the hunter starts running, all of the party
following and holding tightly together. He
may run around the chairs or wherever he
pleases, provided he keeps in the room. For
fully two minutes this must keep up, when
suddenly he will call, “Bang!” and instantly
sit on one of the chairs. Of course there is
a great scramble for every one to do likewise,
but as one chair is short, some one is
necessarily left out, and this person now becomes
the hunter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The game now continues as before, or it
may be varied by the hunter having to find
something hidden.</p>

<p>Any object may be placed out of sight in
the room, and when the hunter nears it, the
company may aid him by the usual words,
“warm, warmer, hot,” or “cool, very cold,
freezing, zero, below zero,” etc. If he finds
it within five minutes, he may choose
another hunter, but if not he must pay a
forfeit, to be determined by the rest of the
players.</p>

<p>Or the game may be played in a similar
way by the use of nautical instead of hunting
terms. Should this be preferred, the
hunter becomes the captain, and instead of
singing to his company he may blow a few
blasts on a horn. He is supposed to be on
shipboard, so he must have ship equipment,
crew, officers, passengers, cargo. Again the
players must be named, only this time call
them lifeboat, rope, anchor, sailor, steward,
captain’s boy, purser, first-mate, doctor, etc.</p>


<h3>FIVE.</h3>

<p>Select a boy and hand him a knotted
handkerchief. He must throw the handkerchief
at a player, and before he can count
aloud five the person to whom it is thrown
must mention a round thing, such as an
apple, a globe. If that person fails, he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
change places with the one who has caught
him, and throw the handkerchief at another.
As no repetitions are allowed it will soon
be difficult to find an object that is round.</p>


<h3>BREAKFAST.</h3>

<p>Every player is seated. Turn to the
person at your right and ask, “Will you
come to breakfast?” To which the answer
is “Yes.” When that question and answer
have gone around the room, the first one
must ask, “What would you like for breakfast?”
Perhaps the reply would be, “Milk;”
and he then puts the question to his right-hand
neighbor, who perhaps would say
“Oatmeal,” and so on, until no sensible answer
can be made, for no repetitions can
occur in this game also. As the different
players fail to respond they must stand.</p>


<h3>ALPHABET.</h3>

<p>Give any letter of the alphabet—for example,
S—to the company, also some paper
and pencils. In five minutes’ time they
should write the names of three celebrated
men, and also three sensible sentences, one
for each man’s name, as, Shakespeare was
born in Stratford on the Avon. Forfeits are
required for failures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>


<h3>NINETY-NINE.</h3>

<p>Cut an equi-triangle out of soft wood or
cardboard. It should measure one foot
each way, and be one-quarter of an inch or
less in thickness. Besides the triangle you
will require white celluloid chips, or the
game may be played with large-sized white
bone buttons.</p>

<p>Lay the triangle on a smooth-surfaced
table, play in turn, and each player should
start at the place. All players must be
close enough to the table to watch the game.
The point of the game is to make a count
of ninety-nine. Whoever first makes that
number has won.</p>

<p>The triangle must be placed far enough
from the table’s edge to allow freedom of
room all around it, and it should be kept
firm.</p>

<p>Put a chip or button with its upper edge
even with the angle from which you start,
and just close enough to make it possible
for it to slide and not receive hindrance.
The chip should touch the entire sliding
length. When all is in correct position, rest
the knuckle of the right thumb (unless you
are left-handed, in that case your left thumb)
on the table, and put the back of the nail of
your second finger about half an inch down
on the inside of the thumb’s fore-joint.
Then push the finger suddenly outward,
running its nail along the table, close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
thumb’s point, and finally raising the finger
so that its tip is on the table at the exact
moment that it has touched the chip. This
should result in sending the chip the entire
length of the angle’s side. To make a full
count the chip must stop with its outer edge
even with the next angle; the entire chip,
with the exception of the edge, being below
it. When this done, score three, and do
the same thing with the next side, you then
score three more; and again with the third
side, making a count of nine in all. Having
gone around three sides, stop until your
turn is reached again. If however, the
chip is not even with the angle, but has not
gone <i>entirely</i> beyond it, the player may
count one, and may continue playing, the
same as if making a full count. But should
the chip slide entirely beyond the angle, he
cannot count at all, but must withdraw until
his turn comes again.</p>

<p>He must not be discouraged, however,
but remember that “He laughs best who
laughs last.” Very often those who start successfully,
become too self-conscious, and
make a bad break towards the close of the
game.</p>

<p>Every time your turn comes, therefore be
as careful as if just commencing. Even
numbers are not counted, make one or three.
To be entitled to three you must be perfect;
short of perfection the count is one or nothing,
as the above rules decree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE DAILY PAPER.</h3>

<p>This game is suitable for either girls or
boys, and furnishes amusement at almost
any age. The interest will be increased or
diminished, according to individual carefulness,
for no one need be caught if they give
close attention. Therefore, to be often
caught indicates lack of interest, which is
not complimentary to your leader, or stupidity,
which is not complimentary to yourself.</p>

<p>Every player assumes the character of a
business man or woman, or they may have
a profession. They may be manufacturers
or tradespeople, it matters little what, provided
there be no duplicates. Choose one
for your leader who will assume no trade
or profession, but will read the newspaper
as will be explained.</p>

<p>All should sit before the leader, so there
can be no mistake about seeing each other.</p>

<p>When every person has settled her and
his part, the leader takes up any daily paper
which is convenient and reads from it; but
whenever the leader pauses, and looks at a
player, whether the pause and look is intentional
or accidental, the one looked at
must at once make a suitable remark about
his profession, business or trade. There
must not be a second’s hesitation, and the
more ridiculous such a remark may be, the
more amusement is gotten out of the game.</p>

<p>As soon as the player has concluded his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
observation, the leader continues reading,
the same as if his theme had not been interrupted,
and in a few seconds, pauses
again, and looks at another player. Then
this player makes his remark instantaneously
about his trade, and thus the game
goes on.</p>

<p>In order to better understand, suppose the
leader reads, “This is Bunker Hill Day.
It is not a legal holiday, but by general
consent the banks and stores laid aside,”
(here he looks at the dressmaker).</p>

<p>Dressmaker: “The big sleeves and wide
skirts are not liked by everybody.”</p>

<p>“The observance of the day by a—”</p>

<p>Marine Artist: “Sale of my painting
‘Off the Rocks at Scarborough.’”</p>

<p>“Is limited to Charlestown district, on one
of whose hillslopes stood the Middlesex
farmers, the hayseed still in their—”</p>

<p>Butcher: “Marrow bones and spareribs.”</p>

<p>“And in their hands the guns that had
been gaining reputation in the shooting
of—”</p>

<p>Grocer: “Eggs twenty-five cents a dozen.”</p>

<p>“And wild fowl. How they refused to
budge before British regulars, until they
had fired all their—”</p>

<p>Confectioner: “Chocolate caramels packed
in layers with waxed paper between.”</p>

<p>“Away, and felt the pricks of the enemy’s
polished—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Ironmonger: “Poker and tongs, shovels
and spades.”</p>

<p>“The world well knows Charlestown
keeps up the remembrance of these—”</p>

<p>Florist: “Water-lily pads, and moss-rose
buds.”</p>

<p>“At a lively rate.”</p>

<p>And so on reads the newspaper, making
the proper pauses and glances, until everybody
has taken part and indeed over and
over again taken part. Care should be used
as to the selection read, as some paragraphs
allow for much more amusement than do
others.</p>

<p>When any player fails to at once make a
suitable remark he must pay a forfeit, which
can only be redeemed by music or recitation.</p>


<h3>THE NEW DIXEY’S LAND.</h3>

<p>This is an out-of-door game, and may be
played on the ground or on the grass, marking
the court or lawn with the same material
as if arranging a court for tennis.</p>

<p>Form a circle with a diameter of twelve
feet, divide the circle into quarters, each
quarter representing a section of our country,
east, west, north, south, and should be so
marked. One letter would represent each
word,—E, for east, W, for west, and so on.
The oldest boy now becomes the owner of
the entire territory, and is named Dixey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
This boy must stand directly at the point
where the lines unite, the middle of the
circle, and as soon as he is in position,
any player may run into any quarter of the
ground. He must not stand on the line;
should he do so, and be tagged on that line,
he can no longer play.</p>

<p>But having run into a quarter, he must
loudly call, “Dixey, I’m on your North
land, now it belongs to me.” Or, “Dixey,
I’m on your South land,” etc. He must
rightly name the section on which he stands.</p>

<p>Dixey must tag him before he is through
stating words above given. Should he fail
to do so, the invading player must then
run from the part he has claimed, all around
the outside of the circle, and then to Dixey’s
station, the centre. Dixey, of course, runs
after him, trying to tag him before he completes
the circuit. Neither may take short
cuts by darting across lines, until the run
around the circle is completed, and the invader
strikes in toward Dixey’s middle
ground. Whoever gets there first is now
owner of all, and the original Dixey can
only get back by earning the position, as
the new Dixey has just done.</p>

<p>The winner of the game is the one who
has been Dixey the greatest number of
times, or should no one be Dixey but once,
whoever holds the position at the game’s
close.</p>

<p>Therefore the necessity of deciding how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
long you will play before the game commences.</p>

<p>Any number that can stand on a quarter,
may be there at the same time, as only one
can be Dixey.</p>

<p>Dixey cannot save himself by failing to
leave his post. The first call he hears, he
must obey, just as any other landowner
would keep off an intruder.</p>

<p>Every rule must be strictly obeyed.
Should any one fail, he is no longer a player.</p>

<p>The game is peculiarly adapted to boys,
and each one must be careful neither to be
rough nor rude. In the straining to get
ahead, it will be such an easy thing to
knock another boy down, or to prevent him
from reaching the goal. First, remember to
be honest; second, to be polite.</p>


<h3>BATTLE OF FLOWERS.</h3>

<p>Why should not boys and girls take the
lead in the popular <i>fête?</i> All who own
pony carts, phaetons, wagons of any sort,
or who can borrow them, may enter the
parade and battle, and why not interest
your Sunday or day school in such an
entertainment and secure a large float?</p>

<p>The designs for floats are innumerable;
among them might be mentioned Flora and
the seasons, America, pagodas, chariots,
Daughters of the American Revolution, the
Floral Queen. The teachers should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the matter in charge, and one of them
should act as chairman, and appoint committees
to attend to all the necessary business.
The scholars should willingly assist
in the gathering of flowers, trimming, or
whatever would be required.</p>

<p>All the vehicles must be transformed into
moving bowers, and this necessitates considerable
work, but it is work that pays;
besides, the real jolly boys and girls will
only consider that they have had great fun.</p>

<p>Decide on your decorations, and then
gather flowers. You will need a great
many to make much show. And wire will
be found helpful in making the flowers
stand upright, or giving the desired twist.
Flowers may be tied upon cord, and when a
long rope is made, it can be wound around,
or fastened to the carriage, but it will take
less time, and be less hurtful to the hands,
if you cut a piece of wire netting the desired
shape, and run the flower stems through
the holes, or cut a piece of soft muslin the
correct shape, and baste the flowers on.
Flowers such as golden-rod, will need to
have all the leaves stripped before commencing
to decorate. Wreaths the exact
size of the wheel hubs will look very handsome,
particularly if the spokes are wound
about with satin ribbon the same color as
the flowers. If you cover the reins, sew
two pieces of ribbon lengthwise, through
which the reins will slip; put full bows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the same on the harness, and cover the
collar with flowers. The same ribbon
should also appear in the carriage decoration.</p>

<p>A very pretty effect is gotten from white
hydrangeas and yellow satin ribbons, or
white hydrangeas tipped with pink and pink
satin ribbons. Violet-colored flowers look
well in such a parade, and a stylish cut carriage
may be trimmed with ears and husks
of corn, suspending the ears by the husks.
The costume of those inside the carriage
must be complementary to the decoration.</p>

<p>The streets through which you pass should
look festive and the spectators be dressed in
holiday attire. A line of march must be
arranged, and, on the counter-march, the
battle begins. Then roses and flowers of
all sorts are thrown from carriage to carriage,
and from the carriages to the people on the
street, and from those on the street to the
carriages; indeed people throw them with
both hands, so excited they become.</p>

<p>Until it is time for the battle, have your
baskets full of flowers to throw well hidden.
And when the pelting begins have a sufficient
supply, so that it will not be necessary
to use any of the decorations.</p>


<h3>GRACE HOOPS.</h3>

<p>This game is usually played out of doors,
but it may be played in large rooms or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
conservatories, provided you put out of
accident’s way all the <i>bric-à-brac</i>, potted
plants, and palms. Try the game also in
an enclosed veranda or sun-parlor, should
the time appointed prove stormy, or the
grass be soggy from last night’s storm, or
there be too high a wind.</p>

<p>Grace hoops require a pole, not as tall
as a maypole, but one smooth at the top.
The one we lately saw had been a noticeable
balsam tree, until cut off five feet from
the ground. Its top was stocky, its side
branches as healthful and green appearing
as ever, notwithstanding the fact that they
had been trimmed close enough to allow a
small hoop to easily fall over them.</p>

<p>The rings called grace hoops are made of
light wood, not dissimilar to embroidery
rings, excepting that they are nearly two
feet in diameter. To make such a game
very pretty, trim the hoops with wild
flowers, wintergreen berries or leaves. All
the girls should wear gay frocks and flower-dressed,
broad-brimmed hats.</p>

<p>If you are playing the game in the spring,
suggest spring flowers and colors in your
costume. A pretty effect would be gotten
from a violet-colored cloth, trimmed with
purple velvet, with a glint of gold revealed
in the shoulder-bow ribbons and wide sash,
the hat being a deep yellow straw flat,
massed with single violets. Arbutus, wild
roses, lilies of the valley, lilacs and cowslips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as, also, the new green, are all suggestive
of spring, and catchy lawn toilets.</p>

<p>Throw the grace hoops over the pole, and
there let them hang until the score has
counted. You may each throw in turn, as
often as has been decided before the game
opens. Each time the hoop hangs on the
pole it counts one.</p>

<p>Pretty silk badges may be lettered or gold-starred,
to denote your score, or you may
use plain cardboard, and mark such with a
lead pencil. Between each round the score
must be marked. After the last round is
played distribute rewards, which may assume
any character you please, but it is
better to give wreaths of flowers, or crown
the hero with laurel. The wreath might go
to the highest girl scorer, and the laurel to
the boy, or give each wreaths, or each bouquets.</p>

<p>A simple grace-hoop game is played by
two people. Stand facing each other, ten
feet apart, and rapidly toss the hoop from
one to the other, catching it on sticks. Try
and see how often you can keep it from
falling.</p>


<h3>AN AMATEUR CIRCUS.</h3>

<p>When so many young people are trained
in athletic sports, calisthenics, delsarte exercises,
etc., why not form an amateur circus
company? Limit the number to twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
four, the girls and boys being equal or unequal
in number, as seems best. Such a
company might easily arrange an attractive
entertainment, and invite their friends to an
occasional matinée performance, or, should
they feel inclined, they could give a performance
as a charity benefit.</p>

<p>Musicians, tricksters, clowns, animals and
a ring would be required.</p>

<p>The space for the ring would be the most
difficult to obtain, but many people have
large shady grounds connected with their
homes that it would be a pleasure to lend to
their young friends.</p>

<p>Outline a ring as you would mark a court,
and make it sufficiently large to comfortably
give your exhibition. Do not attempt a
tent.</p>

<p>Place the seats for your audience six feet
back of the ring, as this allows freedom for
both performers and spectators. Keep an
entrance to the ring free, so that performers
do not disarrange the seats.</p>

<p>As nearly as possible, copy the programme
of the regular circus; therefore, the first display
should be the grand tournament and
triumphal <i>entrée</i>, when the entire company
should march several times around the ring.
Every one should look fantastic; some of
the girls might go bareheaded, others wear
wreaths of artificial flowers, and again others
wear jaunty caps, etc. Remember that
fancy-colored paper, muslin, gold paper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
spangles, will give showy effect. The
clowns should be either very thin or very
stout. The thin ones may be made stout
by building themselves with cotton batting.
A noticeable costume for the clowns might
be white muslin, showered with gold and
silver stars and spangles, or yellow muslin
ornamented with silver or red full moons,
circles or polka dots. And their head
covering might be white beaver hats or
fools’ caps.</p>

<p>Throughout the procession, carry numerous
flags and banners. An effective banner
might be made of white canton flannel,
showered with diamond dust; indeed make
the <i>entrée</i> as gay as flowers, color and
spangles can produce.</p>

<p>The entire company should be active
members, some of them being the drum
corps, others musicians; comic songs should
be sung by the funny clown, assisted by a
chorus.</p>

<p>There should be walking and running
matches, three-legged and sack races, jumping,
fancy tumbling, sensational feats of all
sorts. There could be a mimic football
match, and a tennis tournament between
those who had never held a racket; indeed
anything could be introduced that would
give genuine fun. The clowns should tell
several jokes, and laughable stories, ride
pigs, cows, and make themselves generally
ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps some of the company could borrow
trained dogs or other trained animals.
If so, remember that tricks are always
entertaining.</p>


<h3>THE STILL HUNT.</h3>

<p>Possibly some of the boys’ fathers have
been still hunting, and if so they fully understand
that it means deer hunting without
hounds.</p>

<p>The game still hunt differs from the real
hunt in many ways, but possibly the most
important one is in the fact that the deer in
this case is only the form of a deer. It is
better to play it out of doors, but if you have
a large enough room it may be played anywhere.</p>

<p>Whoever can draw best should be the
individual to outline the deer, and it must be
drawn on the ground. The best ground is
gravel, though, as in the case of tennis, or
other field games, the deer may be designed
on the grass.</p>

<p>The deer should be fully grown and have
large antlers. After he is distinctly drawn
he must be surrounded by a circle, the line
of which measures four feet from the nearest
point of the deer.</p>

<p>When the game is played out of doors, a
smooth round stone about the size of a walnut
will be required; but when played inside
use a fifty-cent piece, or an old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
cent. And for the indoor drawing use
chalk.</p>

<p>The deer circle being now ready, the
girls and boys become hunters, and state
which part of the deer they want. Some
will decide on the antlers, because they will
make a useful ornament, and they will have
them serve as a rack for a gun or umbrella.
Others again want a hoof, because it will
make such a fine hunting-knife or paper-cutter
handle, and so each part of the deer
is divided.</p>

<p>When everybody has selected their part,
the tallest hunter takes his stand, with his
toes to the outer edge of the circle, and as
far from the part he selected as is possible.
He then throws the stone. If it rests on any
part of the chosen place, he may count ten,
but if the stone stops outside of the part, he
is marked down five. He then picks up the
stone, and hands it to the next player, who
is the one next to himself in height. Then
this hunter takes his stand at the place furthest
from his selected part, and thus the
game continues, until all have played in
turn. Then the first hunter takes another
chance, and so on again all follow. The
one counting fifty first has won.</p>

<p>It is necessary to keep an accurate score,
as the fives marked against the hunters have
to be deducted; indeed if great care is not
used, a hunter will be in debt, instead of
earning his game. Therefore, the best hunter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
is he who keeps <i>still</i> and takes accurate
aim. If he fails at the first throwing, notice
where the fault lies,—it may be less force is
required.</p>

<p>It is better to have an umpire; therefore
select one before the game begins, and remember
to pleasantly abide by his decision.</p>

<p>The stone must be altogether on, to be
counted on, and in the case of the antlers
the stone must touch some of the antler
points.</p>


<h3>LAWN GOLF.</h3>

<p>This is played somewhat like croquet,
only twenty-five wickets are used, instead
of nine, and they are placed one after another,
all around the ground. Beyond each
wicket is a small hole, large enough for the
ball to enter, and the game is to send the
ball through the wicket and into the hole at
one shot. When a player fails to do this,
he may be allowed three shots to an inning.</p>

<p>Before commencing the game, state the
time it will be played.</p>

<p>Decide who is to lead by shooting an arrow
from a selected point. Whoever throws
the farthest is to go first, the others follow,
according to the distance made. In considering
space, measure the distance between
the starting place and the arrow’s
sharp end.</p>

<p>If you want a famous good time give a
Lawn Golf Party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>When you do so trim the handles of your
golf sticks with gay-colored ribbons, and at
the game’s close, give the champions paper-flower
rewards.</p>

<p>Exquisite flowers may nowadays be made
out of paper, and the making of such afford
only pleasure. Roses of all shades are fetching,
so also are violets, and some varieties
of lilies. Every one who lives in a large
city will at once know where to get materials
and instruction, and one girl can readily
teach another. Those who live in the country
or small villages, surely have some kind
city friend who can select and send materials,
and possibly written directions about
the making.</p>

<p>After presenting the rewards, have supper
on the lawn, and afterwards other games
are in order.</p>

<h2>GROWN-UPS.</h2>


<h3>ALPHABETICAL GEOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p>Give every one in the room a number.
And when you call for a number announce
a letter of the alphabet. The person called
must, before you count six, apply the letter
to the name of a place and to two things he
might see there.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>No. 1. Y.</p>

<p>I am going to York to see Youngsters and
Yachts.</p>

<p>No. 2. B.</p>

<p>I am going to Baltimore to see Belles and
Beaux.</p>


<h3>COMPOSITION.</h3>

<p>Arrange for it beforehand, and therefore
have the requisite slips of paper, and nicely
sharpened lead pencils ready for all, but if
you are not ready there is a certain satisfaction
in knowing that part of the amusement
may be in the preparation. In the latter
case, have a competition as to who will
make the sharpest points on the pencils, or
cut the papers the most accurately; when
all is prepared, however, give slips of paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and lead pencils to your friends, and ask
them to write the words you will name.
State that they will have fifteen minutes in
which to write a composition, and put into
the same every word you have mentioned.
No one can look over his neighbor’s paper,
and each composition must be signed with
the writer’s full name.</p>

<p>When the time has expired, all the compositions
are collected and read aloud, votes
are taken as to which is the best, and the individual
having received the highest number
of votes is entitled to a prize.</p>

<p>Example: Wreath, Mausoleum, suicide,
farewell, another, conjointly, starred, huntsman’s
song, early, queen, historical, many,
dramas.</p>

<p>Alfred, Lord Tennyson, was for <i>many</i>
years Poet Laureate. He wrote several
poems, descriptive, <i>historical</i>, national and
otherwise. He also wrote three notable
<i>dramas</i>, one called Becket, known as
Thomas à Becket, Chancellor of England,
afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, <i>another</i>
called <i>Queen</i> Mary, the ill-<i>starred</i>
daughter of Henry the Eighth, and Harold,
who was Earl of Wessex, afterwards King
of England.</p>

<p><i>Early</i> in life Tennyson wrote several
poems, <i>conjointly</i> with his brother Charles.
Among these were the <i>Huntsman’s Song</i>,
The Grave of a <i>Suicide</i>, The Fall of Jerusalem,
and the Bard’s <i>Farewell</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Tennyson’s monument is in that great
English <i>mausoleum</i>, Westminster Abbey.
On the dark stone slab, the visitor may frequently
see a <i>wreath</i> of laurel, so placed in
grateful memory.</p>

<p>As this game would oftener than otherwise
be played informally, the matter of
prizes cannot be too simple. If you are in
the birch-bark section, why not make a bookmark
or a napkin ring out of the bark?
Should you be at the seashore make a nest
of shells. For example, find a large mussel
shell, and next to it put one a size smaller,
and so on fit in the others, graduating them
evenly, the top one being very small. Or
give a curious shell, which may be used as
an ornament or receptacle.</p>


<h3>INITIAL PLATTER TWIRLING.</h3>

<p>This is very amusing, but the players
must be on the alert or they will surely be
caught.</p>

<p>Before the game commences, every player
must tell the initials of his and her name,
and to aid memory, slips of paper may be
given, on which each one may write his initials.</p>

<p>When the sentence is called by the person
twirling the platter, all the company must
eagerly listen, or else the platter will fall to
the floor before the one who should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
run for it, recognizes he is the one called.
If the platter is not caught by the proper
person before it ceases to whirl, he or she
must exchange places with the one who has
whirled the platter. As the sentences are
impromptu, they are apt to be absurd and
ridiculous, but in any case they should be
correct, or the one making the error must
give a forfeit. Each sentence must have as
many words as the initials of the one called,
and each word must commence with the
right letter. Example: Frank Fraser Phillips
might be called French Fried Potatoes. Or
Janet Belle Roberts might be June Brings
Roses.</p>

<p>This game should cause much merriment.
It quickens thought and language, and it is
suitable to all ages,—the boys and the girls,
or their fathers and mothers.</p>


<h3>OVER, OVER, WHOSE HEAD IS IT OVER?</h3>

<p>This is a clever trick, and it requires two
persons. The idea is for the confederate
out of the room to correctly name the individual
over whose head the other person is
holding a wand.</p>

<p>A person takes a cane, which he carelessly
points toward some one; while so doing he
is cleverly explaining what he is about to
do, asking people to move, in order to further
mystify, etc. The confederate notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
where the cane is pointing, then goes from
the room, and the one holding the wand
puts it over several heads, saying “Over,”
which the confederate echoes, until finally
the question comes, when the wand is over
the person before surreptitiously pointed
out, “Whose head is it over?” The confederate’s
answer is naturally correct.</p>


<h3>TEAKETTLE.</h3>

<p>This may be played by a number of
people.</p>

<p>A noun which has two or more meanings
is selected. One may be thought of by any
of the players, and in describing the same
he should use the word “teakettle” instead
of the proper name. All meanings of the
word must be explained, but not too clearly
at the first, else the “teakettle” will be
at once guessed. When any of the listeners
think they have discovered the word, instead
of naming it, he should ask a question
regarding the “teakettle” which would indicate
to the one describing the same,
whether the interrogator was correct. If
correct, he too joins in the description, and
throws light on the word. This should be
continued until all the company show by
their conversation that they know the noun
selected. Not infrequently it is necessary
to talk very plainly, or throw “electric
light” on the teakettle before it is guessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Example: The teakettle I have in my
mind, has been from the creation of the
world, and will continue until the world
ends. It is also peculiar in being of the
most service during the winter, and forms a
distinguished position in the homes of all
American households at Thanksgiving dinners.
My teakettle is cultivated on the farm
of many a plain countryman, but graces the
table of many a fastidious city millionaire,
and the longer it lasts, the shorter it grows.
Already somebody is sure they know the
word, and says, “Your teakettle may be
squandered, may it not?” and another asks,
“Wasn’t it Queen Elizabeth who would have
given her crown for a diminutive teakettle?”
And yet another asks, “Is it not savory, and
of great assistance to the poultry cook?”
And thus light is thrown, until the teakettle
in question is known to be another name for
<i>thyme</i>, and <i>time</i>.</p>


<h3>AUTHORS.</h3>

<p>This is a popular game for students young
or old.</p>

<p>Some one who understands should have
charge.</p>

<p>Give each person the same sized piece of
writing paper and a lead pencil. On the
piece of paper he must write a familiar
quotation, and then pass it to his left-hand
neighbor. The one who receives it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
add the author’s name, and also his own.
If he does not know the author, he must
write underneath the quotation the word
“Unknown,” and his own name.</p>

<p>Five minutes are allowed in which to
write a quotation, and three minutes to
affix the name of the author, and the signature
of the writer. The papers are then
collected by the person in charge, who will
then proceed to read aloud the quotations,
authors, and signatures.</p>

<p>All persons unable to write a quotation
must pay a forfeit. All unable to transcribe
the name of the author, must also pay a
forfeit.</p>

<p>Should there be a dispute regarding an
author, the one in charge must decide.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Bottles and blisters, powders and pills,</div>
<div class="verse">Catnip, boneset syrup and squills;</div>
<div class="verse">Drugs and medicines, high and low,</div>
<div class="verse">I throw them as far as I can throw</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 13em;"><span class="smcap">Will Carleton</span></span></div>

</div>
</div>


<h3>AUTHORS.</h3>

<p class="center">No. 2.</p>

<p>The hostess should form a ring with herself
in the centre, and to make it more comfortable
all should have chairs. Number
each person, naming yourself last. Number
one repeats a quotation, Number two tells
the author, Number three gives another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
quotation, and Number four gives the author,
and so on. The person in charge, who
is the one in the centre of the ring, keeps
the game under proper control and time.
No longer than ten seconds should be allowed
for each person to respond. Every
wrong guess of an author demands a forfeit.
Surely, every one can give a quotation.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<h3>GHOST.</h3>

<p>This is a spelling game. A person gives
a letter, not necessarily having any particular
word in mind, his next neighbor must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
think of a word beginning with this letter,
and then say the second letter, the third
person must think of a word using the two
letters previously given, and add the third
and so on, to the end of the word. A person
is not a ghost until he is four times
caught.</p>

<p>The penalties are to be challenged rightfully,
to challenge wrongfully, or to complete
a word. The challenging consists in
doubting a letter which a player has given.
A player may say, “I challenge you,” when
a person has added a letter, if he feels sure
there is no word spelled in that order. If
rightfully challenged, the speaker has one
penalty against him as ghost. If, on the
contrary, he gives the word which he had
in his mind, as he is bound to do when
challenged, the challenger is one-fourth of
a ghost.</p>

<p>Every word finished makes one-fourth of
a ghost, but it is proper to add a letter and
thus form a new syllable. If a syllable of
a word is a complete word in itself, the one
pronouncing the last letter has incurred the
penalty. For example, take the word revelry.
R-e-v-e have been given, and unless
the fifth player can think of n, and change it
to revenue, or some other word, he must say
l, and thus the word ends.</p>

<p>Whoever is ghost has to keep absolute
silence throughout the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>


<h3>CELEBRATED AUTHORS.</h3>

<p>One member of the company should leave
the room, while those who remain determine
what celebrated author he is to represent.</p>

<p>On his return, he must in all respects be
treated as that author would be were he the
guest of the evening. He must be entertained
by conversation and questions which
would be of interest. Neither the conversation
nor the questions may be misleading,
but on the contrary helpful to the discovery
of himself. He may be Shakespeare or Kirk
Monroe, or if a girl she may be Lucy Larcom
or Mary E. Wilkins.</p>

<p>Suppose Shakespeare is the distinguished
guest. Of course all polite people would
rise to receive him, and the hostess would
offer him the most comfortable chair; every
one’s manner would indicate that they were
in the presence of greatness.</p>

<p>The conversation would naturally be of
England and the changes that had come to
her within the last three hundred years.
That the town in which he was born had
changed greatly; that the streets once so
full of mud and refuse were now not only
clean and tidy but almost uncomfortable
with too great cleanliness and neatness.
That the town owned a very pretty theatre,
ornamented with statues of heroes and heroines.
That a fine drinking fountain had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
lately been put there by a philanthropic visitor
from Philadelphia, now dead. That
the townspeople had been known to express
their delight over the fact that he had been
so obliging as to be born there.</p>

<p>He might be asked how he liked Queen
Elizabeth, and if it was true she was as fond
of him as had been expressed, and if so why
didn’t he write something In Memoriam of
her?</p>

<p>If the company discovers that the person
who is personating Shakespeare is not able,
after a few minutes of opportunity, to guess
who he is, they should then throw on more
light, by either asking him more prominent
questions, or in connection with each other
indicate more clearly. Ask some such
question as, How far was the Mermaid
Tavern from the home of John Milton? and,
Did you meet Ben Jonson there? or did
you call for each other and go and dine
together?</p>

<p>There is great difference of opinion as to
the correct way to spell your name. In the
register which marks your birth, we noticed
in reading the surname, that the letter E
was left out of the first syllable. Do you
put it in the last syllable, or is it out of that
also? Did the boys ever call you Bill?
Isn’t Warwickshire beautiful? What do
you think of the river Avon? In what year
did Bacon write Hamlet?</p>

<p>Of course, by this time, the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Author would be guessed and some one else
would leave the room, another Author be
selected, and the game proceed as before.</p>


<h3>THE ARSENAL.</h3>

<p>The players must be seated in a circle,
with the understanding that whoever smiles
must pay a forfeit. No. 1 turns to his neighbor
on the left and sings, while nodding
his head,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Are you going to the Arsenal, the Arsenal,</div>
<div class="verse">And see the animals in Central Park?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The person addressed replies in the same
tune, nodding,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Yes, I’m going to the Arsenal, the Arsenal,</div>
<div class="verse">And see the animals in Central Park.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Then both sing and nod,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Two of us are going to the Arsenal, the Arsenal,</div>
<div class="verse">And see the animals in Central Park,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No. 2 then turns to No 3, nodding and
singing the same question, who replies in
the same way, only singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Three of us are going to the Arsenal, the Arsenal,</div>
<div class="verse">And see the animals in Central Park.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">And so complete the circle, the chorus being
added to by one or more each time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>


<h3>MAGICAL READING.</h3>

<p>Ask your audience to be seated, while
you talk for a few minutes on the wonders
of occult science. Having mystified them
as much as possible, you arouse their curiosity
by announcing that you are now prepared
to state whatever they may choose to
draw or write, provided the sentence is a
short one, by pressing the words or picture
against your forehead, instead of reading
with the eye.</p>

<p>You then distribute lead pencils, and
equal sized slips of paper to all who wish to
try, and take your seat at a table, on which
you put a work-basket, with the request
that when they are finished, they will fold
the papers over once and then drop them
in the basket.</p>

<p>When this is done you draw out any
paper you may first touch; unfolding it so
that you cannot read, you press it against
your forehead, being careful to cover the
entire paper with the fingers of each hand,
which touch each other. You must explain
that this contact is necessary for your
revelation. After some minutes spent in
thought, you read it and immediately draw
another paper, laying each one before you,
behind the basket.</p>

<p>The trick is simple, and consists in reading
any word or sentence which may first
occur to you, for the first paper, but reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the words thereon, or noting the picture
when you lay it behind the basket. The
picture or words on the first paper are read
for the second, the second read for the
third, and so on, until the last one has been
pressed to the forehead, in removing which
it is hidden by being crushed in the hand, or
in whichever way may prove the easiest at
the time, as the last paper is a necessity to
make up for the one you falsely read.</p>

<p>It is not often that this trick is detected,
unless it is bunglingly shown, and for that
there is no excuse, as it is ridiculous to exhibit
magic without long and careful practice.</p>

<p>Always change as much as possible the
method of exhibition and never show this
feat twice in one evening. Remember that
diversion is an important feature in all magical
entertainment; therefore you should
be a capital story-teller, have a fund of funny
stories on which you call at a moment’s need,
for the attention of your friends must be
constantly turned from your nervousness.</p>

<p>Every one understands that they are being
deceived. You must be a clever magician or
they will discover how.</p>


<h3>LAUGHABLE RHYMES.</h3>

<p>This game may amuse any number, if those
playing will each pleasantly do their part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The company should be seated in a circle
and the one in charge repeats from memory,
reads from a book, or makes up a line of
poetry. The individual to whom he addresses
it, must add a line of the same
rhyme and sense.</p>

<p>When the director has given his line, he
runs three times around the outside of the
circle, or he may spin a large tin platter.
The second line of poetry <i>must</i> be added
before he completes his third round of the
circle, or before the platter has ceased to
spin. Should the line fail to be given in
time, the one to give it must pay a forfeit.
The director then gives another line to another
person, the game thus continuing
until all have taken part, or the players
desire a change.</p>

<p>The director may change any time with
any one of the company. Poetry of merit
is not expected.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Director, (giving a line),</p>

<p>“Miss Beecher’s class came down the
street.”</p>

<p>Answer.</p>

<p>“And every one looked perfectly sweet.”</p>

<p>Director,</p>

<p>“Ring, ring, rosy,”</p>

<p>Answer,</p>

<p>“I’m your Josy.”</p>

<p>Director,</p>

<p>“I wandered by the brook-side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Answer,</p>

<p>“I saw you on my morning ride.”</p>

<p>Another way of playing laughable rhymes,
is to give each one of the company a piece
of paper and a pencil. Each paper has a
verse written on it of the same number of
lines in length. But these lines are incomplete,
as each line is minus one word. This
word may be the last one of a line, or it
may be any of the others. Five minutes is
a fair time to allow for the completion of
these rhymes. Then the papers should be
collected and read aloud, the reader indicating
the supplied words. All failing to
complete their verses within the time allowed
must pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<h3>MAKING A DICTIONARY.</h3>

<p>This game is more suitable for scholars;
those who have made a study of biography
and definition. It is readily divided in two
parts, and each part may be played separately,
but it is more satisfactory to unite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
them. The first part is to guess who is personated,
and the second is to write definitions.
If everybody understands or is
studying French it would be a change to
personate a Frenchman, and, in like manner,
if every player understands or is studying
German, personate a German, perhaps some
author, whose book is authority in school.</p>

<p>The leader of the game commences by
stating, “I have compiled a dictionary,” and
if he is personating a German, before proceeding
further he must give that clue. Example:
“Ever since the appearance of the
vocabulary to my German Reader in 1870,
I have been receiving, from various quarters,
suggestions and solicitations of a more general
German dictionary, to be constructed
upon the same plan.” And if he is personating
a Frenchman he must be equally
helpful.</p>

<p>After this the leader is silent until asked
questions, which he must correctly answer.
Should he be representing the notable Noah
Webster, the following would readily discover
him.</p>

<p>“Were you born in the United States?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Were you born in the South?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“In the East?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you living?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Were you very old when you died?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in my eighty-fifth year.”</p>

<p>“What college did you attend?”</p>

<p>“Yale.”</p>

<p>“What was your father’s business?”</p>

<p>“He was a farmer and justice of the
peace.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about your mother.”</p>

<p>“She was a descendant of William Bradford,
the second Governor of Plymouth
Colony.”</p>

<p>“Were you married?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How many children had you?”</p>

<p>“Six; one son and five daughters.”</p>

<p>By this time any player knowing the biography
of Mr. Webster would have guessed
him.</p>

<p>The leader now distributes to each person
equal sized pieces of paper, on which the
same and several words have been written.
He also gives them lead pencils. The test
is to write the best definitions for these
words, which, if honestly done, is without
consultation. A minute is allowed for each
word, and the papers being signed are then
collected, and by the leader read to the
audience. With a dictionary for reference
there will be no dispute as to who has won.</p>

<p>Test words should be common ones, as
they are much more difficult to define. For
instance, Defy,—a challenge. Fortieth,—following
the thirty-ninth, or preceded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
thirty-nine units, things or parts, the quotient
of a unit divided by forty. To-morrow,—a
day after the present. Wrist,—the
joint connecting the hand with the arm.
Rather than such as Homing Home,—used
specifically of carrier pigeons. Subpœna,—a
summons for witnesses. Xanthine,—yellow
dyeing matter in certain plants and
flowers. Islamism,—the Mohammedan religion.</p>

<p>This game played with the right people,
will give a delightful evening.</p>


<h3>DESERT ISLAND.</h3>

<p>Make believe that you have heard of people
living on a desert island, on which there
is absolutely nothing for their comfort or
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Distribute an equal number of pieces of
wood, and ask your guests to cut out utensils
for cooking, furniture, etc. Or give
papers, and let each in the game draw articles,
or take the papers and fold to shape
articles. A limit of time must be named,
and in the end, whoever has made or drawn
or folded the greatest number of recognizable
articles has won the game.</p>


<h3>THE BUTTERFLY TEST.</h3>

<p>Cut white writing paper in uniform size—eight
in width by ten in length. Have as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
many pieces of paper as the number of
painters, also several extra ones, as undoubtedly
the butterfly makers would want
to try again and yet again. One palette
would suffice for a large company, for every
one likes to watch the development of his
neighbor’s work, almost as much as he does
his own. But, of course, more palettes may
be used if desired. Oil paints of divers
colors must be placed on the palette, having
a larger amount of the yellow paint than
of any of the others, for not only are there
more yellow butterflies, but yellow often
conspicuously appears in almost every butterfly.
As many palette-knives will be required
as palettes. Brushes are not needed.</p>

<p>Put one butterfly on one piece of paper
only. Fold the paper you use exactly in
half, creasing it the longest way, thus giving
it the appearance of an ordinary sheet
of letter paper. This done, take the palette-knife
and on its point and edge gather a
little of the paint, putting the knife into the
different portions, and so getting the colors
which you desire. It is better to allow the
paint to extend about half to two-thirds of
an inch along the inside edge of the knife.
All the paint you would need would not
more than cover a five-cent nickel.</p>

<p>When the paint is on the palette-knife,
open your sheet of paper, and in the exact
centre of the inside crease, put the paint.
This is done by putting the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
point of the knife directly in the crease, and
pressing downward, and also a trifle towards
the right.</p>

<p>Be satisfied with whatever leaves the knife
the first time. Do not attempt to pick the
paint off, or stick more on. Then carefully
remove all paint from the palette-knife. For
this you will need a small piece of soft cotton
cloth. Where many people are at work
several cloths should be in readiness.</p>

<p>The palette-knife now being clean, fold
the paper over in the crease first made, being
careful that you have folded it even,
otherwise, the wings of the butterfly would
be out of proportion, one being higher than
the other. When the paper is folded you
will distinctly see the blotch inside, and in
this press heavily with the end of the palette-knife,
starting at the crease and form an
upward long arch, then press again from the
centre towards the right, and arch in the
same way, only proportionately shorter.
The two arches should meet.</p>

<p>When you have pressed over and over
again on the same places, and find that it is
impossible to further spread your paint,
open the sheet of paper, and inside you will
see a butterfly delicately tinted and veined,
his wings full spread as if to alight on a
white clover, or other sweet-scented wild
flower. In pressing out the paint you can
more fully control the palette-knife, as well
as protect the paper, if you put your fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
close to the paint. Sometimes a perfect
butterfly is thus made the first time, but with
a little practice any one may make butterflies
as they will.</p>

<p>Before painting commences, each artist
should draw from a receptacle a small paper,
which will bear a number. This paper must
be held until the prize is given, as an inexpensive
prize would better be awarded to
the one painting the most natural butterfly.</p>

<p>When the one in charge calls a number, the
one having it at once goes forward and paints
a butterfly on a paper bearing the same
number as the one he drew. No matter
how many butterflies this individual may
paint, each paper on which the painting is
done must bear the number drawn. As
each butterfly is painted it is placed on the
top of a large table. When all are through
painting, the judge who has hitherto not
been in the room, examines all of the butterflies,
and decides according to number who
is entitled to the prize. Example, No. 23.</p>

<p>Should there be two or more equally
well done, those who painted them must
each try again. The best of these is then
awarded the prize.</p>


<h3>A SKATING PARTY.</h3>

<p>All taking part should be in costume.
The costumes may relate to a special anniversary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
such as Lincoln’s or Washington’s
Birthday, or a St. Valentine revel. They
may also be simply fantastic or pretty, or
they may recall the old Knickerbocker days.</p>

<p>The <i>fête</i> would have to be under the direction
of patronesses. To their decision is left
the programme, time, place, etc. Suppose
for example, it is Washington’s Birthday
night, some one of the number should
represent General Washington. Other characters
should be prominent Revolutionary
heroes, as John Hancock, General Gates,
General Lafayette, etc. Then, too, Mary
and Martha Washington should be on skates,
and Betty Washington, George Washington’s
sister, and other notable women of the Declaration
of Independence period. But besides
these, there should be Clowns and
Dumpies.</p>

<h2>SPECIAL FÊTES.</h2>


<h3>LINCOLN’S BIRTHDAY AMUSEMENTS.</h3>

<p>Give a sleighing party. Start immediately
after a mid-day dinner and get home before
the sun sets.</p>

<p>Every one should attach a knot of tri-colored
ribbon to his coat or jacket. The
horses, sleighs and whips must be decked
with flags and streamers.</p>

<p>When on the road sing songs of freedom.
“John Brown’s body lies mouldering
in the grave.” “In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea,” etc.</p>

<p>Have a snowball game. Choose sides
and decide who can pitch the farthest.</p>

<p>Balance a snowball on the end of a cane,
and note which boy can longest keep it from
falling.</p>

<p>Try a snowshoe race by picked players.</p>

<p>Make an immense snowball. When it
can be made no larger, let three persons stand
on the top. The tallest should stand in the
centre and wave the flag. One of the party
should take a snap shot at that moment, for
future amusement.</p>

<p>Arrange a skating party the day before,
and test each one’s skill on the ice—who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
can skate the most rapidly,—who can exhibit
the most figures, etc.</p>

<p>Give an up-to-date military tournament on
skates. Example, America and Spain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If there is neither snow, nor ice, have a
bicycle match. Trim the bicycle with red,
white and blue. Each rider should wear
the same colors. The match may be simply
a question of speed. In that case be careful
to indicate the distance. Competent judges
should witness the start and close of the
race.</p>

<p>All difficult questions must be decided by
an umpire.</p>


<h3>ST. VALENTINE GAMES.</h3>

<h4><i>A Valentine Hunt.</i></h4>

<p>This should be given early in the evening,
as it removes shyness and establishes good
fellowship.</p>

<p>Hide as many small valentines as there
are children, and give five minutes to hunt
for them. Those finding more than one
should put the extra ones on a table, and the
children not finding any are then blindfolded
and allowed to draw one each.</p>

<h4><i>Rose Guess.</i></h4>

<p>Present a large rose and let each child
guess how many petals it contains. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
all have guessed, pick the petals off, counting
them as they fall. The nearest guesser
receives a prize. An appropriate prize would
be a bonbon box filled with candied rose
leaves.</p>

<h4><i>Rose Bowl Game.</i></h4>

<p>Put on a small table, a mat of pink
crinkled tissue paper, and in the centre stand
a cut-glass rose-bowl. The bowl should be
covered with huge pink rose petals, made of
paper, inverted as though the rose were held
in the bowl, the petals all meeting in the
green calyx, which covers the opening of the
bowl. Through the calyx, narrow green
ribbons representing rose stems should appear.
Each child, at a signal, should come
to the table and draw one of the “stems.”
On the end of each will be found a pink
candy heart, and to one of these hearts will
be fastened a tiny love-knot ring.</p>

<h4><i>The Walnut’s Fortune.</i></h4>

<p>Open a quantity of walnuts in half. Into
each walnut slip a narrow piece of paper
which will predict the future. Slip a small
elastic over each nut, which will prevent
them from reopening. The boys’ walnuts
should be put in one basket, and the girls’ in
another. The girls’ basket should be offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
first. As each girl holds her hand over the
basket she should repeat:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Steady, good fairy, I am wary,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pray let my hand make no mistake;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I would only the right nut take.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she puts her hand down, lifts up a
nut, removes the elastic, and taking out the
paper, reads her future aloud. Example,
“You will travel around the world. At the
age of twenty-three you will sing before two
thousand people.” And thus the future is
predicted in similar style for other players.</p>

<h4><i>Naming the Roses.</i></h4>

<p>All the young people should personate
favorite roses. Therefore, there should be
many varieties. The parlors should have
arches or wide doorways, through which a
procession may readily move.</p>

<p>The musicians are advised to play something
between a march and a reel, and immediately
each boy signals out the girl that
matches his rose. If more than one match,
he asks the girl he prefers. Then, all keeping
time to the music, they walk through
the first arch or doorway, and so on to the
second, thus in rotation going through all.
The couples should keep about two feet
back of each other.</p>

<p>When all have passed through the last
arch, they join hands, thus forming a circle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and commencing with the first couple, enter
the ring two by two. Two only being in at
a time, when they come out, the two that
followed them in the march enter, and so
on. When in the circle the boy should ask
the girl, “Which rose are you?” She answers,
“Tell me, and I’ll tell you.” Very
often his answer will be, “I don’t know,”
though once in a while he will make a perfect
guess. When his answer is right, he
asks the girl the language of her rose; but
if he has made a mistake, he is obliged to
leave the girl in the ring, and stand under
one of the arches. If the girl cannot answer
his question, she must stand under an arch.
If the boy leaves the ring before inquiring
the rose’s language, those forming the ring
put the same question, and if the girl does
not properly reply, she has to pay the same
penalty as when not replying to the boy.</p>

<p>When both questions are answered correctly,
the boy and girl again join the hands
of the others forming the circle. When
each couple has been in and left the ring the
game is concluded.</p>

<p>Among the rosebuds and their meaning
are: White rose-bud, girlhood; red rose-bud,
loveliness; white and red together,
unity.</p>


<h4><i>Memory.</i></h4>

<p>Put a small table behind a screen. On
this table place thirty different articles, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
pulverized spices, small bottles of
liquid, books, etc. Each player is allowed
ten seconds in which to familiarize himself
or herself with the things on the table.
Then each person writes a list of the things,
titles of books, etc., from memory. The
boy and girl whose lists are nearest perfection
receive valentines as prizes.</p>


<h4><i>Love Box.</i></h4>

<p>Present a pink silk bag to each of the
young ladies, and ask them to take out what
they first touch. Each will then draw a
small pink box, inside of which will be her
fortune written on ordinary sized note paper.</p>

<p>When the young ladies have finished
drawing, pass a red silk bag, filled with red
boxes of a similar size, to the young men.
Each paper in the pink boxes should be
numbered one, two, etc. and the same with
the red. The following are the examples of
the fortunes.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Whereso’er I am, below or else above you,</div>
<div class="verse">Whereso’er you are, my heart shall truly love you.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 6em;">My name is John.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">You will married be</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">At the age of thirty-eight,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or else I’ve made a mistake,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the date is far too late.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now you must guess my name</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or this fortune’s very tame.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Or ask questions, to be followed with appropriate
answers.</p>

<p>“Shall I marry Sue?”</p>

<p>“There’s a rival in the case. A very rich
and stupid fellow.”</p>


<h4><i>The Prophetic Rose.</i></h4>

<p>In an archway hang a huge rose made of
tissue-paper of a deep red color, the petals
being dark at the centre. The players are
told that the darker petals belong to the
boys, and the girls should visit the rose first.
Each girl in turn should step toward the
rose, and break off a petal. On the reverse
side she may read her fortune; for delicately
pasted to the rose petal will be a white one,
and on this the girls fortune will be written.
Everybody reads their fortune aloud, for
all are as interested to learn the future of
their friends as their own. When the girls
finish, the boys follow in a similar way.
Some of the fortunes might be:</p>

<p>“Thou drawest a perfect lot.”</p>

<p>“You will be wondrous happy.”</p>

<p>“Mistress of the Manse.”</p>

<p>“A curate—never slack in duty.”</p>


<h4><i>Make a Valentine.</i></h4>

<p>This will create much merriment and
prove equally suitable for grown-ups or
boys and girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the guests arrive, have ready even-sized
pieces of water-color paper. The
hostess should distribute these and explain
just what should be done. Have water-color
paints, brushes, etc., conveniently near
every one, also a few well-sharpened lead-pencils
might not prove amiss. Either have
the people seated at one long table or at
several small ones, as would be convenient.
Ring a bell when it is time to commence.
In thirty minutes ring again, when all must
stop.</p>

<p>As the designs should be original, no one
must look over his neighbor’s shoulder.
The fact that some would not know how to
paint would have nothing to do with it, as
the entertainment is only a bit of fun and
every one should do his part. Valentines
allow of such diversity in decoration, from
the extreme of the grotesque to the æsthetic
and beautiful, that every one should be glad
to try. Remember, a line of prose or verse
would be an added compliment. For instance,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Prithee tell me, Dimple chin,</div>
<div class="verse">At what age does love begin?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">might be written under the dainty portrait
of some winsome wee thing; or,</p>

<div class="center">My love is like a red, red rose,</div>

<p class="unindent">might be added to the picture of a flaming
red cabbage rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>When the valentines are finished they
should be numbered, each painter retaining
his number on a slip of paper. This done,
gather the valentines and submit them to the
judgment of three people to decide as to
their merit. The painter of the best valentine
should receive a prize.</p>

<p>Then jumble together slips of paper on
which are written numbers corresponding
to the numbers of the valentines. Let each
guest draw a slip, and present him or her
with the corresponding valentine, which
may be retained as a souvenir.</p>


<h4><i>The Court of the King of Hearts.</i></h4>

<p>Decide who will be king. He may get
his costume from a costumer’s or wear a
home-made robe of gold color, decorated
all over with hearts cut out of crimson velvet,
six inches long and in correct proportion.
He should wear a gold crown ornamented
with Rhine stones, and carry a
sceptre. There should be a throne, which
may be a large chair placed on a raised
platform. The throne and platform should
be covered with gold paper, sprinkled with
diamond dust.</p>

<p>All the decorations should suggest St.
Valentine’s evening. Therefore, pink or rose
should be the color effect, and such devices
as Cupid’s arrows, hearts, valentines should
appear. Ask the young ladies to gown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
themselves to represent roses. Therefore
some would wear pink; others, white, etc.
The gowns might further suggest the scheme
by being trimmed with roses. The young
gentlemen should wear rose boutonnières.</p>

<p>All the guests compose the court.</p>

<p>The entertainment may be opened by
the minuet, danced by red and white roses,
after which the entire court enter, marching
two by two. As they march they sing in
honor of their king. When the first couple
reaches the throne, the leaders separate right
and left and turn facing each other. The
others do likewise, keeping the distance between
regular. Last of all comes the king
followed by two pages representing Cupids.
The king marches between the columns,
and finally reaches his throne. When there he
looks smilingly over his court, and then seats
himself. The pages stand to his right and left.</p>

<p>Then the court, at a motion of the king’s
sceptre, waltz, after which the entire evening
is spent amusing the king. He likes songs,
and they become Singing Roses. He likes
recitations, and the roses recite. All the
songs and recitations must be of the heart.
Among the recitations may be “The Garden
of Love,” William Shakspeare; “The Day-Dream,”
Alfred Tennyson; “Telepathy,”
James Russell Lowell.</p>

<p>At the close of a song the king rises, and
waving his wand, the company cease entertaining,
and the Cupids, leaving the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
walk side by side, and finally stop at a huge
blackboard. Then in colored crayons they
each draw a valentine. After which the
King of Hearts asks each one of the company
to do likewise. This affords much amusement,
as many of the valentines will be exceedingly
grotesque.</p>

<p>When all have finished drawing, the Cupids
return to the throne, and the king signals
for a dance. And now a surprise. Eight
dancers appear in heart and valentine dominoes.
Each heart dances with a valentine,
and thus the king continues to be
amused. The first eight who have drawn
valentines quietly absent themselves, and
thus they are ready at the desired time. The
dominoes are made out of white cheese-cloth,
the valentines and hearts are basted
thickly over them.</p>

<p>After the dance the king should rise and
thank the court for what has been done for
his entertainment, after which the recession
of the court should follow. The columns
leading to the throne must be again formed,
the king rises, and proceeds through the
lines followed by his pages, and then the
two nearest to the throne go next, and so on
until all disappear.</p>


<h3>WASHINGTON’S BIRTHDAY ENTERTAINMENT.</h3>

<p>If the hostess is a girl, she should be costumed
as Lady Washington; if she has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
brother, his dress should be a faithful copy
of General Washington’s. The mother of
the young people may take the character of
Mary Washington, mother of George. Ask
your friends to wear an appropriate costume
excepting that of the Washington household;
that family excluded, they are fancy free.
Decorate the house with flags and bunting;
also give an eagle prominent position.
For evergreens use holly, and whatever
flowers may be peculiar to the State of Virginia.
Suggest red, white, and blue in the
supper-room. Example: Cover the dining-table
with blue silk or bunting, and on it
stand cakes frosted with red and white icing,
mottoes in red and white papers, etc. Serve
strawberry and vanilla ice-cream in blue
dishes. Have all the confectionery red and
white in color, and served from a blue-covered
stand. Should you not have blue china
suitable for the confectionery, deftly cover
white china with blue crinkled paper, and
so preserve the colors.</p>

<p>Open the evening with the flag dance.
This is any square dance you may please.
Immediately before it starts, present the
dancers with a tiny American flag, and
whenever a bow occurs, let the flags be
triumphantly whirled. They may be retained
as souvenirs. After the dance some
one previously selected should come into
the parlor. He must be entirely enveloped
in tricolor, which may be done by the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of a large flag, and if necessary a smaller
one may cover the head. The question now
is to guess, Who is this distinguished visitor?
whether it is some one of the Revolutionary
period or of the present, of our own
country, or of another. When the domino
is removed, across his chest will be his name.
It is George the Third, who did not feel very
comfortable at the time of the signing of the
Declaration of Independence. He should
wear a crown, which is easily made from
pasteboard, cover it with gold paper, and
for precious stones glue on rounded buttons
covered to suit whichever gem you may
please-jasper, sapphire, diamonds, or what
not. Whoever makes a correct guess should
receive a gift suggestive of the occasion. A
book about a Revolutionary hero would do,
or any article of jewelry, suggestive of
Washington’s time. There are stickpins
which may be used for scarfs also, that
have the flag in colored enamel. After this,
another dance would be in place, and follow
that with games and patriotic songs.</p>

<p>“The Star-Spangled Banner,” in march
time, would be appropriate to use as the
march to supper.</p>


<h3>APRIL FOOL GAMES AND TRICKS.</h3>

<p>It is always a question whether these
games should or should not be played.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Therefore I offer them with this preface as
also a few words of advice. Be good natured
and do not take offence over other people’s
amusement at your expense.</p>

<p>Never play a practical joke.</p>

<p>Example, Mr. M—— died last night.</p>

<p>Mr. M—— was an intimate friend of a
party present, and as the word pronounced
dyed is capable of two different meanings,
one of the guests interpreted it in its saddest
sense, and immediately fainted. Wholesome
fun promotes laughter and good-fellowship;
indulge in it all you will, and so
help your little world to be the merrier.</p>

<p>On a pure white tidy write in distinct
letters upside down, the words, “April
Fool,” and get some boy to lean back against
them. When he walks about the room afterwards,
his black jacket is decorated.</p>

<p>If you have an old cane-bottom chair,
cut the seat out, but not too close to the
frame. Fit this nicely in and offer the seat
to any of the larger boys or girls. Instantly
this individual finds himself slipping down,
but is more frightened than hurt.</p>

<p>Upholster a long low box to represent a
divan. The top should consist of neatly
tacked down stiff brown paper, and over
this throw a long thin rug. Suggest to two
or three of your liveliest friends that they sit
together on this divan. In a few moments
the room will resound with shrieks of laughter,
for they will be seated on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Give a florist’s box temptingly covered
with tissue paper and tied up with gold cord
to one of the guests. He will unfasten the
cord, take off the paper, and lift the cover
only to find <i>nothing</i> within.</p>

<p>Should your mother or sister be expecting
a new spring bonnet, beguile the milliner
into letting you have one of her nicest hat
boxes, into which you should put your three
years’ old Derby, and then watch the result.</p>

<p>A questionable joke would be to send a
party invitation to your old friend, inviting
him to an equally old friend’s house, and
wait around to see him enter.</p>

<p>Tell John or Mary there is an oat for them
at Mr. Blank’s. They thinking you have said
“a note” immediately go to get it, and fully
comprehend your meaning when they are
handed a tiny package of tissue paper which
serves as a covering to one oat and the words
“April Fool.”</p>

<p>Arrange portières so they may be drawn
on either side of a long mirror, as window
curtains are drawn from the centre of a
window. Before this make an effective
group of a number of boys and girls. The
rear ones should stand, the ones immediately
in front should be seated on the floor.
Above them should be written on a mirror
these words, “April Fools.” When every one
is in place, a boy standing on the left and
right of the mirror should draw the portières.</p>

<p>A part of the refreshments for such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
evening should be cakes frosted with salt
and others stuffed with cotton, oranges filled
with sawdust, tiny blocks of wood and
small balls of cotton, covered with chocolate,
so simulating chocolate caramels and creams.
Have also motto papers deftly covering little
pebbles, and iced coffee, which will be found
to be the most acid of iced vinegar. But do
not let your refreshments end with such a
menu, or good nature even with the jolliest
would cease to be a virtue; when a little
fun is gotten, serve a delicious supper.</p>


<h3>EASTER FROLICS.</h3>

<p>The time for Easter amusement is during
the week which follows Easter Day, and it
would be a pretty idea at such a season to
give a short tableau entertainment in connection
with music and games, the tableaux
indicating the superstitions of various countries.</p>

<p>When the tableau is shown, announce
what it is intended to represent; for example,
in Russia the Easter festival might
almost be termed the “kissing festival,” for
beginning with the Emperor, who on Easter
Day kisses various generals and even privates
in his army, the singular contagion spreads
throughout the empire, apparently affecting
both aristocrat and plebeian.</p>

<p><i>Tableau.</i>—A boy representing the Russian
Emperor kissing a member of the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>In the olden days of France it was the
custom for a Christian to give a Jew an
Easter box.</p>

<p><i>Tableau.</i>—Two boys, one representing the
Christian; the other, the Jew. The Christian
must be in the act of boxing the Jew’s
ear.</p>

<p>Follow this with the France of to-day.</p>

<p><i>Tableau.</i>—An interior of a church, extravagantly
trimmed with flowers, and brilliant
with lighted candles. It should be crowded
with boys and girls, mothers and fathers, all
in brand-new clothes.</p>

<p>Show Spain as a dark-haired girl, with a
mantilla over her head, kneeling in a church
before a mammoth candle—the Paschal candle,
nine feet long. In order to make it
seem taller, stand it on a marble pedestal.</p>

<p>Rome, with a procession of gayly attired
children, and a boy representing the Pope,
in the most elegant of robes, carried in a
crimson chair, over which is a canopy.
This chair must be preceded by two boys,
each carrying white ostrich-feather fans.</p>

<p>Germany, with a group of dancing girls
and boys, the girls wearing small, close-fitting
white caps, full white aprons over dark
gold-braided skirts and white sleeves; the
boys with knee-breeches, white stockings,
showy vests and gold buttons. Or show a
hare running from a nest filled with colored
eggs, before which two little children kneel.
The nest should be placed under a bush, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
one of the children should wear a laughing
face, for she holds up an egg.</p>

<p>England, with a crowd of boys and girls
returning from Hampton Court, Kew Gardens,
or Stoke Pogis with their arms literally
filled with willow-boughs and branches of
blossoms—yellow, pink, and white—with
which they will decorate the church for
Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>Switzerland, with a band of musicians
carrying guitars, and going from house to
house singing some sweet carol, their hats
and caps wreathed with flowers.</p>

<p>A very pretty way to amuse children of
all ages is to hide eggs in the grass or under
bushes, and then have an egg-hunt. All
eggs found may, of course, be carried home.
Give five minutes for the hunt, and it will
prove great sport for lookers-on also.</p>

<p>For another game, raise a tent decorated
with flags, cheese-cloth streamers, or ribbons.
Opposite the tent in which the guests
are to be seated, and ten feet distant, is a
post or tree on which to put a prize. At
the base of the post put a basket of thin
china eggs or glass balls, and also one at
the tent door, only fill this basket with excelsior.
The game is to find the person that
will throw the largest number of eggs from
one of the baskets into the other and not
break them. Whoever wins is rewarded by
the prize.</p>

<p>For little children, form a ring, and pitch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to the centre of the ring a hard-boiled egg,
and let them scramble for it. For larger
children, let them pair off, a boy and a girl;
thus alternating, they form a ring. Then
start thirteen china or glass eggs, one after
the other, from hand to hand, taking the
egg in the right hand, passing it to the left,
and so on round the ring. If an egg drops,
it must stay where it falls until the other
eggs have gone around the ring three times.
It may chance by that time that all the eggs
have dropped. When the third time around
is complete, immediately a grand chain is
formed, and the children dance, and go back
to position, picking up the eggs as they
dance. If the egg is not picked up, keeping
time to the music which is being played
throughout the game, that person cannot
retain it, but must give it to the one following.
Sometimes no eggs fall, then the game
is kept up until all the eggs have passed
rapidly around three times. But when
dropped and picked up, they must then go
around once, and after this final circuit the
game is concluded.</p>

<p>Boil a dozen or more eggs in logwood of
different strengths of dye; they will then be
colored violet or purple. Give these eggs,
with a large pin or pen-knife, to young people
to decorate. Offer a prize for the best
decorations within fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Still another game is to knock eggs. Hold
an egg so that the small end is shown between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the forefinger and the thumb. Sit or
stand opposite to the person with whom you
are playing. Then knock each other’s eggs.
The knock should be swift and hard, and
whoever’s egg is the first to crack must
now be given to the opponent. When
starting, each should have an equal number.
Whoever has the most eggs after playing
ten minutes has won.</p>


<h4><i>Finding the Hare.</i></h4>

<p>The hare is nothing more nor less than a
box made in exact copy of a hare, about
six inches long. When opened it shall be
found full of rose-colored and rose-flavored
confectionery.</p>

<p>The company are told that a hare is hidden
and whoever finds it is the owner. It
is a bewitching sight to see the merry hunt
and great sport for those engaged.</p>


<h4><i>The Parlor Egg Hunt.</i></h4>

<p>Buy confectioners’ eggs, which come in all
sizes, from the ostrich size to a humming
bird’s, made of chocolate or icing, and
trimmed with flowers or tiny ribbons.
Hide the small eggs, and state in which
rooms they are hidden. Allow five minutes
for the hunt, each striving to find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
most. Ring a bell to start and end the
game.</p>


<h4><i>Ostrich Egg Search.</i></h4>

<p>This is played exactly like the thimble
game. Put a confectioner’s ostrich egg in
full sight, and at a signal every one begins
to look for it. When it is seen, the finder
signifies the fact by sitting down, and this
continues until all are either seated or give
up. The hostess inquires of the first one
who sat down where the egg is, and the
answer is given in a whisper. If correct,
it may be retained as a favor, if not, the egg
must be drawn for.</p>

<p>The hiding must be cleverly managed, so
that while the egg is in sight, it is, however,
in an unexpected spot, and where it cannot
be handled. Then, too, there should be a
bogus egg, made from tissue paper, closely
resembling the confectioners egg. Many
will mistake the egg.</p>


<h4><i>Basket Eggs.</i></h4>

<p>Put two baskets at the end of a room, each
basket lined with wadding, and containing
a dozen of eggs. Opposite these baskets
on the other side of the room, have two
empty ones lined in a similar manner. Two
persons step forward, and at the ringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of a bell start to put the dozen of
eggs, without cracking, into the empty
basket, the one who succeeds first being
victor.</p>


<h4><i>The Game of Cluck.</i></h4>

<p>Perhaps this is the jolliest game of all, and
it is essentially for boys. Whoever gives
the party should ask each of his friends to
bring a chicken—a real live chicken—and if
he is sure he would not recognize her when
with a barnyard of others, he must tie a
ribbon around her neck; he must also bring
some hard-boiled eggs. The court used
should be surrounded with a high netting,
and the centre of the court marked with a
cross.</p>

<p>At a signal all the players, each with his
fowl in his arms, must enter the court, and
the host, going to the centre, now becomes
auctioneer, and taking each offered fowl in
turn, he loudly calls, “How many eggs am
I bid for this chicken?”—two eggs, three, or
whatever the number may be; no one must
bid what he cannot pay, and the chicken is
given to the boy offering the largest number,
and the eggs are given to the previous owner
of the chicken. He may put them wherever
he pleases, only they must be somewhere
within the netting.</p>

<p>The sale being over, the “cluck” commences,
for it is now each one’s aim to recover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
his chicken, which can only be done
by finding the requisite number of eggs
given for her. This is much easier said than
done, for the boys will have hidden them
in their pockets and other peculiar places.
Meanwhile the chickens, running in every
direction, are very apt to “cluck” loudly.</p>


<h4><i>The Bird’s Nest.</i></h4>

<p>Put a bird’s nest in a room; hunt for it as
you “Hunt the slipper,” only, instead of saying
“warm, warmer,” and so on, you cluck,
cluck, cluck soft or loud as the party goes
towards or from the nest. Only one person
hunts at a time; everybody else clucks.</p>


<h3>MAY-DAY FESTIVITY.</h3>

<p>A May-Queen party is conducted in a
variety of ways. Very simply you may
say: “I am arranging for a Maying party;
will you come? I shall be so glad to have
you.” And without further form than the
above invitation, only mentioning the time,
place of meeting, luncheon, etc., everything
for a day’s outdoor frolic is adjusted.</p>

<p>But the correct fashion is vastly different.
The invitation is of the same character as
that given for any other party. The paper
on which the invitation is engraved should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
be decorated. The decoration should be
suggestive of the occasion—a trimmed May-pole,
a throne for the Queen, or the Queen
herself. Also, in the left-hand corner of the
invitation, state the time when the tally-ho
or carriages will start: they start from the
house of the giver of the party. A good
hour is ten o’clock, and the guests should
be there ten minutes earlier.</p>

<p>All Maying parties should be in charge of
a chaperone, not only for Madame Grundy’s
sake, who would do a great deal of talking,
but because there is then some one older
than yourself to consult with in case of
need, as also some one to superintend those
who would arrange the refreshment table.
And as this party must</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">fall upon a day</span></div>
<div class="verse">In the merry month of May.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">everybody should wear holiday attire, as,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In the days when we went gypsying,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">A long time ago,</span></div>
<div class="verse">The lads and lassies in their best</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were dressed from top to toe.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In France this day was dedicated to the
Virgin, and the most popular girl was called
the “Lady of the May.” She was always
crowned and adorned with flowers, and sat
in state on a miniature throne made of flowers
and branches, while her maids of honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
begged for money from all who passed that
way, to be spent on the religious feast held
later.</p>

<p>And our May-Queen can have her white
frock too, as dainty and pretty as that of
any Parisian maiden, if she will only wear
warm flannels underneath it. Remember,
that though May days are oftentimes warm
and sunny even to uncomfortableness, their
temperature cannot be depended upon.</p>

<p>The May-Queen should be arranged for
by the giver of the party, and also her six
maids of honor. The Queen only wears
white. The maids should wear frocks of
different hue, and each represent a woodland
flower or fern. For example, rose
pink garlanded with pink rose-buds and
roses; baby-blue and forget-me-nots; pale
violet and violets; cowslip yellow and
cowslips; Nile-green and maidenhair-fern,
etc. The guests should wear flowers, and
may or may not represent flowers, as they
choose. Only they must wear gay attire.
The boys might dress as gentlemen of the
court, adopting the fashion of princes, lords,
pages; and do not forget the fool, with his
cap and bells, to amuse the Queen. Or all
may wear grotesque apparel—it is go-as-you-please
fashion—only if the grotesque is
decided upon, all should adopt it; the Queen
could personate Maid Marian, with gilt
crown on her head, and one of the boys
assume the character of Robin Hood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be a delight could all of these
occasions have a May-pole, wound about
with gay color, and long ribbon streamers
firmly fastened at the top, which during the
dances should be braided and unbraided
again and again. It requires a tall straight
tree, which should be firmly set in the
ground, after the order of a flag-staff. The
tallest May-pole ever set up in England
was on the Strand, London, and was one
hundred and thirty-four feet high. A pole
twelve feet from the ground, however, will
give just as much pleasure at the ordinary
May-Queen party. Around it join hands,
and sing any familiar English ballads, or
songs from the opera of <i>Robin Hood</i>. It
might be well to have a rehearsal of two or
three songs beforehand, if you should be
particular about your music at the time of
the party. As for dances, they should be
intermingled with the songs, waltzes, mazourkas,
schottisches—any dance that you
may know. Besides this, play one and
another ring game, even if you are ever
such big boys and girls. Always remember
to pay homage to your Queen, being sure
that she is leading.</p>

<p>Whoever gives the party is of course
responsible for refreshments, which are usually
served picnic fashion on long tables
in the woods, near to the place where the
games are played. The provisions should
be carried in a separate wagon, and be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
out of sight until it is time for lunch. The
tables may be made very attractive by
means of mosses, wild flowers, and grasses.
One such table was of exquisite beauty, its
only adornment being ferns. A border of
them was pinned or basted all around the
cloth, made higher at the corners. A large
cut-glass bowl stood in the centre of the
table, filled with maiden-hair, and two tall
slender vases, one shorter than the other
and filled with fine ferns and vines stood
at irregular distances. When the refreshments
are ready, the hostess must escort
the Queen, and lead her to the position of
honor. Next to follow should be the maids
of honor, and the rest as they will. In
every instance the Queen must be served
first; indeed, she should be shown every
consideration.</p>

<p>The Queen’s throne should be erected
near the May-pole. It is generally made in a
sort of bower of bushes. Sometimes a large
stone has to form the seat; cover this with
flowers, so that your Queen is really sitting
in a floral chair. Make her crown before
leaving home; it can be cut out of pasteboard,
and covered with gilt paper, and
when you get to the fields twine flowers
around it; or you may assimilate a crown
with a wreath of wild flowers. In either
case present it to her with great formality.
Having led her near the throne, two of the
boys should stand on either side of her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
suspend the crown between them, immediately
above her head. While they are
in this position, the hostess must step towards
the Queen and say, “In the name of
this court, we crown you Queen of May.”
The boy standing at her right then leads
her to the throne; when she is seated, the
other boy presents her sceptre, and her entire
court sing a chorus previously decided.</p>

<p>The girls might all carry wooden hoops,
and having wound flowers around them, take
them to some poor child or sick mother or
sister on their return home, and so have the
pleasantest sort of an ending to the May-Queen
party. In our joy and gladness
under the cloudless sky, on a moss-covered
walk, with violets and other wild flowers
at our feet, we should not forget the many
more to whom such a party would seem
almost as a day in Paradise.</p>


<h3>FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION.</h3>

<p>Every boy, to properly celebrate Independence
Day, should be well stocked with torpedoes,
large and small, fire-crackers, cannon,
and gunpowder. He should know that
the starry flag flutters from his home, and
that the red, white, and blue is a part of his
attire.</p>

<p>Early in the day a battalion of patriotic
boys should march and countermarch up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and down the principal streets, while all
the while martial music is heard, and the
shrill bugle call answers the exultant drum
beat. A banner should lead such a procession,
and the Star-spangled Banner should
triumphantly wave throughout the entire
line.</p>

<p>Jolly fun may be had in the after part of
the day, by setting an old barn on fire.</p>

<p>Very often the boys’ fathers or uncles own
a barn that they would rather have out of the
way than not, and the Fourth of July is the
most appropriate time in the entire year
for a conflagration. When a barn is to be
fired, be sure that it is carefully prepared beforehand,
with a coating of tar and long
wisps of tarred paper, and the boys cannot
be too cautious not to get on fire themselves.</p>

<p>Should boys not be successful in finding
a barn to burn up, perhaps they could find
a dead tree on a friend’s vacant lot. A tree
would make a perfect tower of flame, and
could be seen for miles around. It, too, will
blaze all the fiercer if you apply a coating of
pitch. Those engaged in this sport should
wear their oldest clothing, in order not to
make themselves a nuisance to their mothers
and sisters or thoughtlessly waste their
fathers’ money.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of the boys would like a
receipt for a powerful noise. It is simple
enough—nothing but chlorate of potash and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
sulphur mixed; you should put several
pieces of paper around it, though, and hammer
it down as heavy as you can.</p>


<h3>HALLOWE’EN GAMES AND TRICKS.</h3>


<h4><i>The Nut Trick.</i></h4>

<p>The shell must be prepared before the
performance. Remove the kernel by boring
a hole, or opening the nut at one end. Take
out the contents by the aid of a lady’s hat-pin,
and instead of the kernel, slip in a short
piece of scarlet-colored baby-width ribbon.
Then putty or wax the opening over, and
color the putty or wax with a dye, crayon,
or paint, the exact shade of the nut.
The nut being thus prepared, you may now
lay it on the table before your friends, and
present a bunch of many-colored ribbons of
the same width and length to them. Ask
that some one select any piece he chooses;
you must have a don’t-care air, as though it
didn’t make any difference to you which
piece was chosen. While, on the contrary,
you care so much, that should a wrong selection
be made you must at once tell an
interesting story, which will help your
friends to forget that the ribbon has already
been selected, and you should make use of
this opportunity to offer the ribbons over
again. This time the selection will likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
be correct. It would be wise to have the
majority of pieces of ribbon the color of the
piece in the nut, as that color would catch
the eye first and stand a better chance of
being taken.</p>

<p>The right ribbon now being chosen, make
a great point of looking at it; hold it up at
arm’s length, so that all the audience may
see it. Then ask the party who made the
selection to put it back in the bunch with
the others and mix them all up to please
himself. When he has finished, face the
bunch of ribbons, and loudly repeat, three
times over, “Ribbon, go into the nut.”
Then ask your friend to go forward and
take the little hammer which he will find on
the table and crack the nut open. When
the nut is opened, sure enough inside is a
scarlet ribbon.</p>


<h4><i>Burn a Lady’s Handkerchief, but Return it Whole
Again.</i></h4>

<p>This requires a tin cylinder about eight
inches in diameter and twelve inches in
height. Into this put a perfectly fitting tin
vessel, which is divided strictly in half.
When this vessel is slid inside of the cylinder
the whole does not look unlike a canister
with a cover at each end. Having the
handkerchief, hold it so that everybody sees
it, and talk fluently, keeping the body constantly
in motion; indeed, making so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
motions that no one has noticed that you
have packed this handkerchief in the upper
division of the tin vessel, and that, as you
are walking towards the candle, you have
turned the cylinder upside down, and that
also the handkerchief you are now holding
is really not a handkerchief at all, but a thin
piece of muslin you have prepared to simulate
a handkerchief. Pour on it a few drops
of alcohol, which will help it to burn even
more rapidly; tear it, if you think it more
effective. When the owner thinks that her
handkerchief is forever destroyed, cleverly
manage to invert the cylinder, take out the
handkerchief, shake it well, holding it so
that all the audience sees that it is not even
scorched, and then return it to the lady.</p>


<h4><i>The Bowl Trick.</i></h4>

<p>Fill a tiny tumbler with water and cover
it with a bowl. Then state you will drink
the water in the tumbler underneath without
moving the bowl.</p>

<p>Of course the company do not believe you,
and you ask all to turn their backs, or close
their eyes, if they will promise not to look,
until one of the party counts ten. Immediately
they have turned their backs, or closed
their eyes, you pick up another glass of
water and hastily swallow a few mouthfuls.
They hear the sound, but no one can look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
until ten is counted. By that time the glass
from which you drank is hidden again, and
the company catch you wiping your moist
lips. Undoubtedly one of the number will
be so suspicious that he will lift the bowl to
see, and then is your opportunity, for you
at once pick up the glass and drink, saying,
as you put it down, “<i>I</i> didn’t touch the
bowl.”</p>


<h4><i>An Impossible Jump.</i></h4>

<p>Take a gentleman’s hat, and, turning it
around so that every one sees it, ask your
friends whether, if you put it on the floor,
they could jump over it. Of course they
will answer, “Yes.” Then stand it close
to the wall, and tell them not to all try at
once, but take their turn to jump.</p>


<h4><i>Turn a Goblet Upside Down Without Spilling the
Water.</i></h4>

<p>Fill a glass goblet so as not to allow any
water to drop over the edge. Cover the top
with a piece of paper; on the paper put your
hand, and turn the goblet rapidly over; then
remove the hand. The upward pressure of
the air will prevent the water from spilling.</p>


<h4><i>The Hat Omelet.</i></h4>

<p>Everybody who enjoys tricks is no doubt
familiar with this. It is very easy to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>First state that you are about to make an
omelet. Then break three eggs into the
hat, and appear to add a little milk and
flour, after which shake all together and hold
the hat over a lighted lamp, candle, or gas.
After a few moments lift out the hot flaky
omelet and pass it to your friends; otherwise
they will think they have been deceived.</p>

<p>The secret is, the omelet was cooked on
the range, and was in the hat when you
commenced to exhibit the trick, the hat being
held too high for the audience to see
inside. The eggs were not full, only the
shells, the contents having been previously
drawn through a tiny aperture at one end.
Laugh and talk a great deal and it will not
be noticed that you do not put in the cornstarch
and milk; also let a real egg drop,
as if by accident, on a plate standing on the
table before you, or let a tablespoon or
knife fall. This will attract all eyes and
further prevent discovery. As in other
tricks, you should practise it before showing
it to your friends.</p>


<h4><i>The Wonderful Carafe.</i></h4>

<p>An empty carafe is brought by your confederate.
This you should rinse and drain
in the presence of your audience, in order to
satisfy them that there is really no mistake,
that the carafe is positively empty. After it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
has well drained, dry it, wiping it around
with the greatest care. In the towel which
your confederate brought you he also
brought a bladder, in which was a weak
preparation made up of spirits of wine,
sugar, and water. In this way the carafe is
filled without the audience detecting. The
glasses are already in position, and in each
one has been put a drop or two of flavoring
extract, such as pineapple, lemonade,
orange, peppermint. The magician then
inquires if any one would like a glass of
lemonade, and being answered in the affirmative,
he pours the same from the carafe
by filling the glass in which the drops of
lemonade extract have been placed. In like
manner he will give a glass of orangeade, or
whatever drink corresponds to the extract in
the glasses.</p>


<h4><i>The Vanishing Ten-cent Piece.</i></h4>

<p>Put this coin in the palm of your hand and
take pains to let everybody see it. Then
state that if any one of the audience will
call out, “Vanish,” it will disappear.</p>

<p>The reason why is because the nail of
your middle finger is covered with white
wax, and closing the hand forcibly the coin
instantly fastens itself to it. You must then
open the hand wide and show that the ten-cent
piece has really gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The tricks now being over, the audience
rose to congratulate their young entertainers
and also to exchange a few words with one
another, and in so doing many of them did
not discover that refreshments were about
to be served until they were asked to take
seats at the small tables that had most mysteriously
appeared.</p>

<p>The refreshments were very simple, being
only vanilla and strawberry rolled wafers
and delicious tea. The tea was, of course,
poured into the prettiest of Japanese cups,
and carried on richly decorated trays, on
which were laid divers colored Japanese
napkins, while the graceful, cordial, Japanese-robed
young girls added an indescribable
charm.</p>

<p>And thus closed this dainty, interesting
entertainment amid the pleasant chatter of
the happily seated, congenial company.</p>


<h4><i>Blindfolded Prophecy.</i></h4>

<p>Should you be in the country on All Hallowe’en,
one of the party should be blindfolded
and sent into the kitchen garden, of
course using every security against accident.
The person sent must pull up a vegetable,
and without shaking off the dirt from the
roots, bring it back with him. Should it
have a great quantity of mould hanging to
its roots, that is a sure sign whoever has it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
will make a wealthy marriage. If, on the
contrary, there is but little mould, he will
make a poor marriage. If the vegetable is
tall and well shapen, this proves he will
marry a tall, beautiful girl. If, however, the
vegetable is short and crooked, he will
marry a short and homely girl. If a vegetable
is brought in without any roots, the
person bringing it will be a bachelor or old
maid.</p>

<p>Care should be taken in the playing of
this game to prevent the house and clothing
from getting dirty; therefore be watchful
and hold the vegetable you bring at arm’s
length.</p>

<p>The best place to decide the vegetable’s
shape, mould, etc., would be in the kitchen,
or on the piazza. If the latter is enclosed,
lamps could be carried out there, if not,
possibly the light from the windows and
hall way would be sufficient; or try a lantern.</p>


<h4><i>The Divining Mirror.</i></h4>

<p>Hold an unpeeled apple in the right hand
and a lighted candle in the left, while you
stand in an empty, unlighted room before a
mirror.</p>

<p>Then you must eat the apple and watch
sharp, for you are to see your future husband’s
or wife’s face in the mirror. The
face will appear over your left shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>This game is also part trick, as fairy folk
are apt to be famous tricksters and therefore
not very trustworthy, especially if it is after
dark.</p>

<p>One of the boys will likely have stolen
back of you, disguised with a false face.
He has reached you on his hands and
knees, and when all of a sudden he rises,
you will be so startled that it will be an
easy matter for him to escape without detection.
Or a girl could do the same as a
boy.</p>

<p>In order to more fully cover one’s tracks,
it would be well for the tricking player to
blow out the candle as he appears over the
shoulder. This, too, will partly conceal the
features, for puckered lips and eyes fixed
steadily on the flame will not look natural.</p>


<h4><i>The Tumbler Test.</i></h4>

<p>Fill three tumblers with water. One must
hold blue water, such as the laundress uses
for clothes, another must hold soapy water,
and another clear water, while still another
must be empty. These tumblers should stand
on a table directly before the individual who
is to be blindfolded. After he is blindfolded,
change the position of the glasses, placing one
where the other one stood, and so on. Then
instruct the party to dip his fingers into one
of the tumblers. Having felt around, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
fingers are dipped into the clear water, and
thus he learns that he is to marry a beautiful
rich girl. Had he dipped into the soapy
water, it would have meant that he would
marry a poor widow; if in the blue water,
he would be a noted author; if in the empty
glass, he would die a bachelor. This game
is played in the same way with the girls,
only, of course, changing the sex, as,
for example, marrying a rich, handsome
man.</p>


<h4><i>The Penknife Trick.</i></h4>

<p>Before leaving the room state that while
you are away any one may place a pen-knife
where he may please, and without any
word being spoken you will find it.</p>

<p>Of course you have a confederate, who
remains behind and notices where the knife
has been put.</p>

<p>When you enter, walk towards one of the
corners in the room; if your confederate is
looking up, you will know you are in the
right corner, but if he is looking down you
must try another. If you notice he is not
looking up when you have tried all the
corners, then walk towards the centre of the
room, and between the corners; at one of
these points he will raise his eyes. In this
way, you will get the location. You must
then diligently search, and when your confederate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
lets something drop on the floor you
will know you are <i>very close</i> to the penknife.
Sometimes it is in a person’s pocket; for that
reason watch just the moment when your
friend has given you the clue. Possibly your
hand may be on some one’s shoulder; this
would indicate to search that person.</p>


<h4><i>Ball Trick.</i></h4>

<p>A girl must take a ball of rose-colored
worsted and toss it out in the garden as far
as she can. She must be careful, however,
not to lose hold of the end of the worsted.
Then she should walk up and down the
parlor or piazza, winding the worsted up;
as she walks she sings,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Who holds my thread? Who holds my clue?</div>
<div class="verse">For he loves me and I him too.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All of a sudden, if the game is properly
played, the worsted will refuse to come.
If the worsted breaks in her exertion to
wind it, she will never marry; but she
should keep firm hold and wind slowly, and
in time will thus surely reach the person who
has caught the other end. This individual
is to be her future husband. Generally the
“husband” part is a trick, for some one
will hold the worsted that she would never
marry; for example, a boy many years her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
junior, or her old grandfather, or brother.
This game being played for the same reason
as many another, “only for fun.”</p>


<h4><i>The Fortune Apple.</i></h4>

<p>On several pieces of wood, thin as paper,
write, in ink or paint, girls’ names. Slip
each name into an apple. This set will do
for the boys; make similar ones for the
girls. Fill three portable tubs with water,
and set an even number of apples floating
in each tub. Fasten the arms of three boys
securely back, and cover them entirely with
water-proof cloaks. Lead each boy to a
tub and ask him to repeat distinctly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Witches and wizards and birds of the air,</div>
<div class="verse">Goblins and brownies, all lend me your care,</div>
<div class="verse">Now to choose wisely for once and for all,</div>
<div class="verse">And ever your names in praise loudly I’ll call.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then each boy must put his head down
and try to catch in his teeth an apple. In
it he’ll find the name of one of the girls
present, and she will be his fate. If the
name is a strange one, there will even then
be teasing enough for him. After the boys
have all tried the game, then it is time for
the girls.</p>

<p>Lead a girl up to a tub and blindfold her;
lead her around while she repeats the rhyme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and with the words “loudly I call,” she
must bend down and try to catch in one
hand an apple or, if she prefers, she may
try to spear an apple with a fork. If the
latter way, only one drop of the fork will
be allowed. If it sticks far enough in an
apple not to fall altogether, her fate is sure.</p>


<h4><i>The Money-Maker.</i></h4>

<p>This is one of the large number of trick
games, and like all the others it is very easy
when you know how. It is played by two
people, both of whom understand the trick,
and it should be the effort of the company
to discover as soon as is possible what that
trick is. When the trick is discovered the
game is simple. To prove that you know
it, you should take the place of one of the
players. If the game then goes on satisfactorily
you are out, but the others remain
in until they either give up or learn the
secret also.</p>

<p>The money-maker leaves the room and
on his return his confederate will ask him
questions. His answer will prove to the
company that he understands which business,
trade or profession they have decided
he must enter in order to make money.</p>

<p>The secret is easy to discover if you are
on the alert; it is the first business named
after a question which has commenced with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the letter O or which contains the exclamation
oh! Example:</p>

<p>The company have decided that the
one who has left the room must be a publisher.</p>

<p>“Will you be an organ grinder?”</p>

<p>“No, I thank you.”</p>

<p>“Will you be a physician?”</p>

<p>“I would not like night work.”</p>

<p>“How would you like farming?”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know! you’d like to be a tailor.”</p>

<p>“But I know I wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, will you be a publisher?”</p>

<p>“Just the thing.”</p>


<h3>CHRISTMAS JOLLITY.</h3>


<h4><i>The Yule Log.</i></h4>

<p>Young people should costume themselves
in grotesque apparel. They may be Twelfth
Night characters, Viola, Olivia, Sir Andrew
Aguecheek, Sir Toby, Sebastian, sea-captains,
lords, priests, officers, musicians, etc.,
or assume any disguise indicative of
Christmas.</p>

<p>Early in the evening, several of the company
should disappear, but with great
hilarity return, drawing in the Yule log.
This is nothing more or less than a rugged
log. Knotted at each end with long strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
ropes, by which it is pulled. As the young
people draw it they should sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Welcome be ye that are here,</div>
<div class="verse">Welcome all and make good cheer;</div>
<div class="verse">Welcome all another year,</div>
<div class="verse">Welcome Yule.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This verse should be sung over and over
until the Yule log lies on the hearthstone.</p>


<h4><i>Christmas Pie.</i></h4>

<p>Two people, each wearing interesting costume,
and with masked faces, walk in, rolling
before them on a wheelbarrow an enormous
pie. It is made after the fashion of a
Jack Horner pie, being in a deep dish covered
with diamond-dusted white paper, with
tiny ribbons exposed.</p>

<p>The first performance is to roll the pie all
around the room, and then to the centre,
where they will sing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Who’ll have a bird from this Christmas pie?</div>
<div class="verse">Whoever guesses me may answer I.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For a few minutes all the company keep
quite still, then the guessing commences;
when the correct names are mentioned, the
couple unmask, and at once the correct
guesser draws a ribbon. He will find on
the end of it a candy bird,—perhaps a robin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
redbreast made of candy and stuffed with
sugarplums. As soon as the bird is drawn,
one of the parties who has rolled in the
wheelbarrow imitates a bird-song on a harmonica.
This is easily effected without discovery,
as everybody’s attention is directed
to what has been drawn.</p>


<h4><i>Tableaux Vivants.</i></h4>

<p>A catchy tableau series would be Mother
Goose and her children celebrating Christmas.</p>

<p><i>Tableau First.</i>—Mother Goose in her tall,
cone-shaped hat, riding on an enormous
goose. Copy her and all the other costumes
from Mother Goose’s book.</p>

<p><i>Tableau Second.</i>—Her children faithfully
charactered. Little Jack Horner should be
sitting in a corner, eating his Christmas pie.
The King in his parlor should be dressed to
represent a king. Simple Simon should
meet a pieman going to the fair, etc.</p>

<p><i>Tableau Third.</i>—A sleeping apartment,
Mother Goose and her family in bed.
Great prominence must be shown to Mother
Goose, whose bed is in front, and near
her some of her more notable children.
This scene may be readily arranged by putting
small cots on the stage; the children
can lie down dressed, the coverlets hiding
their clothing. Near each bed put that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
would indicate their character, as example,
the big pie for the pieman.</p>

<p><i>Tableau Fourth.</i>—Santa Claus at home
about time to start. Interior of a room,
simply packed with all sorts of hobby-horses,
dolls—big and little, dressed and
undressed—musical birds, woolly sheep,
sleighs, drums, tenpins, everything in the
toy line that could be imagined or described;
while in a large easy-chair before the lighted
grate-fire sits old Santa himself, as gray-bearded,
fat, and jolly as ever.</p>

<p><i>Tableau Fifth.</i>—Little Bo-Peep fell fast
asleep and dreamed—</p>

<p>Show Santa Claus again, this time out-of-doors,
on his sled drawn by swift reindeer;
but the reindeer have stopped, for Bo-Peep
stands before them, her shepherd’s crook
leaning over her shoulder, her sheep all
around, and they, as also Bo-Peep, gazing
at the presents—sled, Santa Claus’s pack, at
hat, beard, miniature tree, full stockings, and
all. Bo-Peep wears a regular shepherdess
costume, the sheep are toy sheep on wheels.
The bells should jingle loudly until Bo-Peep
appears.</p>

<p><i>Tableau Sixth.</i>—The Christmas tree.</p>

<p>A large tree filled with toys; leaning
against it is a ladder, which Mother Goose
climbs, and then unfastens the various gifts.
Her children are all grouped around the
bottom, and impatiently await the arrival
of their presents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Tableau Seventh.</i>—The Christmas dance.</p>

<p>Mother Goose and her children dance
around the Christmas tree. Waltz music is
played; they dance once around, when the
curtain is drawn.</p>

<p><i>Tableau Eighth.</i>—Mother Goose’s children
eating their Christmas supper. A long table
covered with a white cloth, and decorated
with lighted candelabra, flowers, bonbons,
fancy cakes, china, silver, and cut glass.
All the children are seated around, Mother
Goose at the head, and to her right her son
Jack, then Jack’s wife, then a boy, then a girl,
and so on around. Each child is in the act of
eating, drinking, lifting a cup, a candy, or
indicating some natural movement at a supper
table; their heads should be turned as
though they were in conversation.</p>

<p><i>Tableau Ninth.</i>—Mother Goose and her
family in a well-arranged group now stand
and sing a jolly good-night song. This
song may be acted by those on the stage,
but the singing is done by an unseen chorus.</p>

<p>Follow this with two tableaux, opposite
in meaning.</p>

<p><i>Tableau One.</i>—The empty stocking. A
poverty-stricken looking room—bare floor,
a hard-wood chair and table (on the table
stand a few pieces of cheap china), a window
with a broken pane, in which a bunch
of paper or canton matting is stuffed to keep
out the snow; a small kerosene lamp, the
light from which comes dimly. A poorly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
clad and as poorly fed appearing little girl;
one of her thin hands rests on the table,
while the other holds an empty stocking, on
which the child sadly gazes.</p>

<p><i>Tableau Two.</i>—Bless you honey-bugs!
Yo’ feels gay.</p>

<p>This also is a plainly furnished room, but
it is trimmed with Christmas greens, a large
star and tree being particularly conspicuous.
There are several colored children running
around, some dancing, with toys in one
hand and a full stocking in the other, others
taking things off a little tree, others again
eating sugarplums, or striding across the
bare floor in eager pursuit of a dropped
cornucopia or cinnamon cake. Their dusky-faced
mammies, meanwhile, laugh at them
through the half-open doorway.</p>

<p>And thus tableau might be described after
tableau. But a few hints may be helpful.</p>

<p>Carefully study scenic effect. “How
beautiful!” is so often the exclamation regarding
a well-dressed stage, even before
any person appears or one word is spoken.
Remember to use harmonizing colors, and
to throw on different-colored lights. The
latter may cost a little money, but it will
repay a hundredfold. A white light changing
to pink, again to yellow, rose or green,
as the scenery may require. In every way
catch the eye.</p>

<p>Remember, the tableau is but for a minute;
let that minute be perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, for example, let a fountain
play in the large grounds or garden. This
can be easily arranged by the proper management
of a hose. You can surely place
a piece of oilcloth under the moss over
which the water flows, and have sponges
conveniently near.</p>

<p>Be careful to select pretty and noticeable
toilettes. If you are taking the character
of a queen at a drawing-room, dress as the
queen, not as her maid; but should you be
a maid, wear jaunty, gay attire, and do not
costume yourself in a severely cut brown-cloth
tailor suit.</p>

<p>Use all the accessories possible—music,
song, recitation, as either may be given off
the stage as an accompaniment to a tableau.
Be sure there is no catch in the stage curtain,
and that the prompter understands all
his duties. Every one should be punctual
at rehearsals; and the night of the entertainment
all the cast should be ready thirty
minutes ahead of time, as that will prevent
worry and nervousness. And if everybody
is calm, and understands his part, there is
no question as to success.</p>

<p>“The Birds’ Christmas Carol” would make
a pleasing tableau.</p>


<h4><i>The Annunciation.</i></h4>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The angel greets the Virgin mild;</div>
<div class="verse">Hail, Mary, full of grace! thy child</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Son of God shall be.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>This tableau represents an interior: the
room has a deep frieze drapery over the
mantel, before which Mary kneels on a low
cushion; to her left, and considerably before
her, is a large jardinière filled with ascension
lilies; and directly before her is a
table, on which is a roll of parchment partly
unfastened. By the table stands the angel
with hands outstretched towards her.</p>

<p><i>Tableau Second.</i>—The shepherds see the
angels bright.</p>

<p>Scene out of doors, with shepherds in their
usual costume, each shepherd holding a
crook, while back of them, huddled close together,
stand the herds of sheep. Before the
shepherds, and a trifle to their right, is the
angel, with outstretched hands, indicating
the way.</p>


<h3>BIRTHDAY IDEAS.</h3>


<h4><i>A Birthday Picnic.</i></h4>

<p>A pleasant number is twenty. Ten girls
and ten boys.</p>

<p>Be driven to the destination in large market
or hay wagons made festive with flags.
Each girl should bring luncheon enough for
herself and one of the boys. And the boys
should be responsible for the outfit for games,
such as ropes, archery, grace hoops, tennis
net, balls and racquets.</p>

<p>If you are not going to a regular picnic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
ground, you will require tables. Therefore
borrow five cutting tables from your mothers
and these can be folded and put in the bottom
of the wagon, and four persons can
easily sit at each. The boys can arrange
the seats, which might be the wagon seats
built to the requisite height by supporting
each end on a pile of stones, or convenient
rocks may be chosen, or take the rails from
the post-and-rail fence adjoining. Only in
that case, remember to put them back again.</p>

<p>Use plated spoons, forks, etc., so as to save
worry, and Japanese napkins, which may
do double duty, as they make pretty tablecloths,
and there is no fuss about having to
carry them home. If you take sandwiches,
wrap them neatly in white tissue or waxed
paper. Use thin wooden platters instead
of china, and no one will be afraid of chipping
them; besides they are so light, and
after luncheon they, as also the napkins and
tablecloths, may be burned up, if you are
careful not to set the woods on fire.</p>

<p>You might find it pleasant to put the
lunches, wraps, etc., in one wagon, and have
all the picnickers in the other. Trusty drivers
for both wagons will be necessary.</p>

<p>After the lunch is over and cleared away,
games and races will be the order of the
day.</p>

<p>But don’t forget you must be home by
sundown. When all have bundled into the
wagons to return, let song follow song.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
One of the big boys might act as director
of the chorus.</p>


<h4><i>A Birthday Floral Ball.</i></h4>

<p>The entire house, including the halls,
should be trimmed with asparagus and Japanese
lanterns. From the drawing-room
ceilings suspend inverted cones of asparagus,
and as pendants from these fasten
Japanese lanterns. String evergreens around
the stair banisters and halls. Indeed, make
of your house, including the dining-room, a
sort of fairy bower, on which the Japanese
lanterns at happy intervals, cast light and
color.</p>

<p>The orchestra should be hidden in a tiny
forest, and their music should be jolly, light
and pretty. Among the numbers have the
“Dance of the Flowers,” by Tschaikowsky.
Follow this with several flower dances.
Example, “The Sweet Peas Waltz.” The
girls’ costume should be white tarletan,
effectively trimmed with sweet peas. The
boys should have sweet pea boutonnières.</p>

<p>The Pansy Cotillion. For this dance wear
crêpe lisse, tarletan,—indeed any flimsy
material you choose, but it must be of one
of the pansy colors; and as the pansy has
so many shades of brown, yellow, purple,
deep rose, etc., the variety which would
mingle, as the several figures are given,
would result in a kaleidoscopic effect of
color and beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps a few solo dances could be arranged.
If so have a Cowslip dance, when
the little maiden should be frocked in pale
yellow, or the Heliotrope, with a frock of
lilacs. Another might dance the Forget-me-not,
and wear a gown of blue.</p>

<p>While still another dance might be termed
the Water-Lily, which would necessitate a
frock of white and gold, as the blue and
pink water-lilies are comparatively rare.
Whichever flower is represented should be
worn, either on the hair or dress.</p>

<p>Then should come the Wild Flower Minuet
when daisies, buttercups, clover, chicory,
violets, honeysuckle, and other wild flowers
could vie with each other in the stately
graceful movements. Follow the minuet
with the Butterfly promenade and dance.
In this a large number should engage, as it
is quite proper there should be butterflies
flitting from flower to flower. Any dance
may be appropriated to the butterflies, but
they should select their own partners from
any of the flowers they please. The butterflies
will wear almost as many colors as
the pansies, and silver, gold or other butterflies
should be fastened on the shoulders or
on other parts of their costume.</p>


<h4><i>A Birthday Matinée.</i></h4>

<p>The afternoon may be made perfectly fascinating
by giving a birthday matinée. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
young lady should costume herself as Little
Buttercup of <i>Pinafore</i> fame. Wear a large
hat, grotesquely ornamented, short parti-colored
skirts, and above all things carry a
well-filled market basket. She should sing
Little Buttercup’s song, and also act and
dance. As the whole thing is a burlesque,
it need not be correctly done, only be sure
to get some graceful girl to take the part,
and one who will bring out the laughter by
her bits of humor here and there. If the
party is for children, the basket should contain
inexpensive toys, and when singing,
“I’ve ribbons and laces, to set off your
faces,” waltz up to a group of children and
distribute the toys. Continue this when
singing the chorus, as also during the playing
of the interludes, until each child has a
gift. Should the party be for older people,
instead of toys give suggestive presents.
Example, a whip to a horsewoman, or a tiny
pair of oars to a rower. The music is from
the opera <i>Pinafore</i> and can be purchased or
mailed from almost any bookstore. When
people are through laughing over this part of
the programme, tell them that confectioners’
buttercups are hidden in the drawing-room,
library and hall; that they are in three colors,—violet,
white, and pink,—and that all
of the guests are expected to hunt for them;
that a bell will be rung as a signal to commence
the hunt, and in like manner to close
it; that five minutes time will be allowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Three prizes will be awarded; the first to
be given to the finder of the most pink
buttercups, the second to the one finding the
greatest number of buttercups adding all the
colors together, the third to the one finding
the fewest. Should any one be so unfortunate
as not to find any, his penalty will be to
pay a forfeit. If this individual is a musician,
his forfeit should be a song or an instrumental
solo, or should he be a recitationist, he
must read or recite, if neither of these, require
him to put himself through a key-hole. This
is done by writing the word “himself” on
a small piece of paper, rolling it over until
still smaller and slipping it through the key-hole.
You will require two pounds of buttercups,
dividing that amount in the colors mentioned.
Roll each candy separately in tissue
paper, corresponding in color, and hide with
care. If for a children’s party, place <i>bric-à-brac</i>
and all breakable articles beyond their
reach, and direct the little people so as to
avoid accidents.</p>


<h3>BIRTHDAY TABLEAUX.</h3>


<h4><i>Tulips.</i></h4>

<p>Group the children so that they look
pretty. They could wear green clothes to
represent stalk and leaves, and have large,
colored-paper petals fastened to their waists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and with wire shaped and bent upward they
would look like veritable tulips. Then a
few others could, in a previous tableau, show
the act of planting tulip bulbs and watering
some growing tulips.</p>


<h4><i>The Cotillon.</i></h4>

<p>Eight girls and boys should be dressed in
Knickerbocker attire, and stand as if ready
for the first figure of the Cotillon.</p>

<p>This tableau should be set in a drawing-room.</p>


<h4><i>Flitting Fairies and Butterflies.</i></h4>

<p>Gay music is heard and in come the fairies
dancing, followed by a train of dancing
butterflies, costumed in red, yellow, and
white.</p>

<p>The wings may be of tinted crêpe paper
or tarletan held in place by stiff wire.</p>

<p>The fairies should wear short fluffy gowns
of airy gossamer, heavily covered with
spangles and diamond dust. With each
movement they must glimmer and glisten.</p>

<p>The scene may be set in any pretty drawing
room, but more properly with a background
of palms and potted plants.</p>

<h2>METHODS OF CHOOSING PARTNERS.</h2>


<p>Pass baskets of flowers to the ladies.
Enough bunches have been prepared and
laid in the baskets for each one of the ladies.
On a tray are bunches of leaves and vines;
pass these to the men.</p>

<p>The leaves will match the flowers, as a
bunch of pansies will have a corresponding
bunch of pansy leaves, a bunch of lilies of
the valley its bunch of lily leaves, etc., etc.
Where roses are used, a bud matching the
rose may be put with the leaves, or better,
the ribbon tying a bunch of rose leaves,
might match the rose it is supposed to go
with. Of course, the pansy-leaf man will
hunt out the lady with pansies; and the
lily-leaf man, the maid with the lilies.</p>

<p>Take bristol-board and cut it in small
pieces, the size and shape of large rose
petals. Tint these pink with a bit of yellow
on the narrow end, where the petal is supposed
to have left the rose. Write in gilt
paint on each of them a word, any noun,
verb, adjective, etc. Then bend and twist
in the fingers until they look like veritable
Katherine Mermet or La France petals.
Have enough so that each girl invited may
have one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Take more bristol-board and make deep
red petals; on these write with gilt paint a
part of speech, noun, verb, adverb, etc.
Make enough to supply each man.</p>

<p>These at the time of entertainment should
be passed just before you wish the partners
chosen. Then the man whose petal reads
<i>adverb</i> will seek among the pink-petaled
girls until he finds an adverb.</p>

<p>Of course, in a large company there will
be several nouns and several adverbs.
But the noun man will of course offer his
arm to the first pink noun he finds. Be sure
to have the petals match. If you must have
five red petals reading <i>verb</i>, be sure to have an
equal number of pink verb petals, e. g. pink
petals reading <i>play</i>, <i>dance</i>, <i>sing</i>, <i>run</i>, <i>talk</i>.</p>

<p>Have two baskets, one knotted with pink
ribbon and the other with red. These
baskets should each contain paper hearts,
about three inches long, and wide in proportion.
The hearts may be suspended by
means of narrow pink satin ribbons, and
each heart is slightly decorated with water-color
paints. In the same basket no two
hearts are alike, but their duplicates are
found in the other basket. When the duplicates
are found, partners are decided.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Have two bags of walnuts. One is to be
passed to the girls, the other to the boys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
To each walnut a tiny slip of paper has been
glued, on which half of a familiar quotation
is written. One half of the quotations are
in the girls’ bag, the other half in the boys.’
The girls’ bag is passed first. When the
boy is able to complete his quotation, he
discovers his partner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When an equal number of boys and girls
are present, for example, ten each, mark ten
slips of paper according to the numerals, 1,
2, and so on. Then throw them into a bag
and jostle them together. After which pass
to the girls. They should each draw one
paper.</p>

<p>When the girls have drawn, offer slips
of paper in the same manner to the boys,
who will draw likewise. Corresponding
numbers are partners.</p>

<h4><i>Forfeits.</i></h4>

<p>The exacting of forfeits for tardiness or
failure in the playing of games will usually
lead to as much amusement as the games
themselves.</p>

<p>Those who subject themselves to forfeiture
may give a trivial article just as satisfactorily
as an expensive one, or they may simply
write their names on a slip of paper, and
hand that to the person in charge. Each
player is bound to redeem his name.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the game the host, or
any individual he may appoint (provided
that person has no forfeits), collects all and
puts them out of sight of the audience, and
commencing with the one at his right, he
takes the players in turn.</p>

<p>That party now sits down and the one in
charge holding over his head one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
trinkets or whatever the object may be,
says: “What a jolly thing! What a smart,
pretty thing! What will the owner do?”</p>

<p>The party in the chair inquires, “Does it
belong to a lady, or to a gentleman?” He
is at once answered correctly and then responds
by advising a difficult or ridiculous
performance. The individual who owns the
forfeit must now perform what has been
advised. As soon as the party has redeemed
his pledge, another forfeit is redeemed after
the same method, and so on, one by one,
until all articles are returned to their owners.
Each forfeit is naturally redeemed amid
peals of laughter.</p>

<p>The following may prove helpful to those
who have to declare penalties.</p>

<p>1. Fold a piece of note-paper in the shape
of a fish.</p>

<p>2. Say, Quizzical Quiz, sister Smith, five

<h2>IN THE ADIRONDACKS.</h2>


<p>It was the last week of July, and the
guests of a certain hotel, located amidst the
pine and balsam of the famed Adirondack
wilderness, were thrown into a flutter of
excitement.</p>

<p>It had been steadily raining for three days
and nights, and now that the fourth day
was nearing its close a golden light appeared
in the west. The mirror-like surface of the
lake before the hotel rapidly revealed the
many shades of crimson red and deep gold,
while fleecy clouds of pink and white merged
into deeper tints.</p>

<p>Every one was on the piazza, called there
by an enthusiast to witness the beauty of it
all. Every face smiled because the long
storm was over at last, and there seemed a
promise of radiant sunshine for to-morrow.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice from the north piazza
called to a young gentleman who had been
walking about with a rather dissatisfied air,
“I hear wheels. Now for the excitement
of an arrival.”</p>

<p>It was only the waiting of a few moments,
and two bay horses, much bespattered with
mud and mire, drew the heavily built two-seated
surrey to the hotel steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Guests stood about by twos and threes,
most of them with half-averted faces, not
willing to openly show the inquisitive feeling
that each possessed. However, many
furtive glances were cast. Perhaps among
the most searching, were those given by the
dissatisfied young man.</p>

<p>“Permit me, madam.” It was the proprietor’s
voice, as he aided a tall, fair-skinned,
stern and aristocratic-looking matron
to alight, assisting her meanwhile to
unfasten her travelling cloak, which had
caught on a nail in the end of a seat. The
lady slowly remarked, as her feet touched
the horse block. “That nail has been rather
too much in evidence.”</p>

<p>By the matron’s side a young lady had
sat. This fact had been observed by all the
guests, before they had turned their heads
away, and now that she too had left the
carriage, her golden hair and soft hazel eyes
were mentally remarked, as also her graceful
carriage and elegant tailor-made gown.</p>

<p>The proprietor, lifting one of the hand-satchels,
leaving the umbrellas and other
small luggage for the porter, led the way to
the office.</p>

<p>Then they hastily entered, and a few
minutes later walked through the dimly-lighted
corridor, for it was not yet dark
enough to illuminate.</p>

<p>“I reckon that girl has never been in the
woods before,” said the dissatisfied man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
his friend. For now, side by side, he and
a young fellow about thirty strode slowly
up and down, exchanging confidences and
chatting in a desultory fashion.</p>

<p>“She does not seem to the manner born,
that’s a fact,” said the other, “but she’s an
interesting type, and probably an addition
to our house party.” He turned an interested
face towards his friend and said:
“There’s far more the flavor of Narragansett
Pier or Bar Harbor about her than of the
woods, or she may have come from Saratoga.
We’ll not have to wait long to see,
or I’m not a correct judge, but her mother
may prove a formidable chaperon.”</p>

<p>The mother and daughter, for their relationship
was at once identified, some one
having accommodatingly referred to the
register, and reported information to the
others, were not long in reappearing, and
the young men, still walking back and
forth, were not surprised to discover that
their prediction was correct.</p>

<p>“Maud, dear, how shall you exist here?”
were the half-petulant words overheard as
the mother languidly seated herself.</p>

<p>“It will not be Saratoga, I confess. But
isn’t that lake enchanting?” The girl’s face
was very fair and bewitchingly amiable.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is pretty. But shall you ever
forget our trip to this hotel? Such roads!”</p>

<p>Maud met her mother’s questioning eyes,
then noting a middle-aged woman approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
them, with face full of kindly greeting,
waited.</p>

<p>“You are strangers,” were this lady’s first
words, adding as she reached forth her
hand: “I fear you will feel lonely and
tired, after the long drive.”</p>

<p>The mother at once extended her hand.
Then the lady asked the girl, “Have you
ever been in the woods before?”</p>

<p>“Never, and my mother fears I shall not
like it. It did seem lonely, the last drive
through the pines,” and the sensitive mouth
quivered ever so slightly, as she explained.
“The drive up was so long, the roads so
thickly wooded, and here,” with a half-frightened
glance about, as though she
feared a fox or a bear would cross the walk
before her, “you have only the lake.”</p>

<p>Without a word the lady laughed merrily,
but hastily checked herself. “I promise you
that if you will only join in our sports you
will find that there is much here besides the
lake. Though,” coyly scanning her, “the
lake has its amusements, fishing, boating.
Oh, the gentlemen here will be delighted to
introduce you to it.”</p>

<p>Maud’s mother looked both surprised and
confused. The lady continued, as though
she noted her not. “You will find the camps
about the lake quite as entertaining as Saratoga’s
Floral Fête, or indeed any fashionable
watering-place amusement.”</p>

<p>“Camps? I don’t quite understand,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Maud’s mother remarked, with a touch of
bitterness in her tone, for the darkening
wood about, now that night was coming
fast, made her slow to relent. It was strange
she had chosen to come to such a spot.</p>

<p>“I think one has to visit these camps to
understand,” the lady explained. “But you
will always find them hospitable, furnishing
afternoon tea every day you care to call.
And some days there are special <i>fêtes</i>, full
of pleasant surprises, when amusements
such as the thimble game and proverbs are
played, at which prizes are sometimes offered
as an added incentive. Last season
the hostess of one of the camps gave a children’s
party. There happened to be a few
here that year, for children are a rarity in
the Adirondacks. Of course their parents,
uncles, aunts and cousins came, too. That
entertainment has been talked about ever
since. The party opened with the wild
flower hunt. Small bouquets had been hidden
among the balsam boughs, low enough
for the little ones to reach; others were behind
bushes or rocks. These bouquets were
made up of clover, daisies and wild roses.
Whichever child found the most wild roses
received a prize.</p>

<p>“This amusement was followed by the
hunt for Cinderella’s Slipper. The successful
one at this game also received a
prize. After this, the hostess invited all the
children into the balsam-covered lean-to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and told them a story about the old man of
Humbug Mountain. Humbug Mountain
towers just behind, you notice the tallest
mountain over there, don’t you?” and the
lady motioned to the left, as they faced the
lake.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what has reddened the trees so?
Why, mother, did you ever see anything as
beautiful?” and while pronouncing the word
“beautiful,” Maud’s countenance was full
of delight.</p>

<p>“That is the afterglow,” the lady replied,
but not waiting for further remark,
she continued: “I was telling you about
the old man of Humbug Mountain. The
hostess explained to the children that sometimes
he visited her camp, and when he did
so he whistled, and that if he should
whistle that afternoon, she would take the
children back of the lean-to to see him. At
that very moment a whistle clear and shrill
was heard, and the children, already enamoured
with the story, could scarcely be
sufficiently restrained to allow the hostess
to proceed. When the laughing, curious
children ran behind the lean-to, sure enough,
as had been promised, there was an old
man. He was standing on a table. It was
a dwarf skilfully arranged by two people.”</p>

<p>“Oh that was it?” Maud interrupted, for
she had listened intently, and was apparently
as eager to discover the identity of the
old man of Humbug Mountain, as had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the children of the party, and then she
added: “I happen to know about that, for I
was part of a dwarf once,” and with a wise
little shake of her head explained, “It is
arranged by two people.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and is it not capital?”</p>

<p>“Fine, when it is well done,” and Maud
who was already feeling at home with her
companion, added: “And of course the
dwarf from the mountain would be well
done.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he was. He told short, witty
stories, laughed, danced and capered to the
children’s great delight. They would clap
their hands for joy. It was a rare sight for
the grown-ups to watch the color come and
go in their expressive faces, their fluffy curls
and tangle of waves and braids tumbling
about as the little girls shook with laughter,
and some of the boys were even more amusing
than the girls, because they looked so
earnest, even solemn, in their efforts to find
an explanation for the old man. One little
chap said he would get his father to carry
his rifle now all the time, because they
might meet the old man sometimes when
he wouldn’t feel as jolly, and what then?
In fact he was about certain he had seen
the old man one day stealing away behind
a big stump, and even some of the children
laughed when he explained: ‘It was the
very same day, that I almost saw a black
bear. I could hear him growl. I tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
I ran! Like as not there was a fox too, or a
wild cat?”</p>

<p>“Well, after the dwarf exhibition, there
were refreshments at which the children
toasted marshmallows and popped corn.”</p>

<p>“Why, after all, Maud,” said her mother,
thawing out suddenly, “I fancy you may
like it here. There seem to be things
going on.”</p>

<p>“<i>Like</i> it,” quoted the lady. “No one
ever wants to go home when she once gets
a taste of Adirondack life. It is like the
hounds following the deer. People take to
the woods.”</p>

<p>Suddenly there sounded through the hall
the first measures of an orchestra.</p>

<p>“The music has begun, and I must dress,”
said Miss Friend-in-Need, noting the questioning
glance between mother and daughter.
“That music is a signal to-night. A
few of us give a part of the Midsummer
Night’s Dream this evening, in the parlor,
and we are to costume ourselves as far as
possible before supper.</p>

<p>“What fun we’ve had getting the affair
up! You may not know that it has simply
poured here for days and days, but we’ve
laughed until we’ve cried at our rehearsals,
and so have scarcely been troubled by rain.</p>

<p>“You’ll surely come to the first and last
performance of this wonderful company,
will you not?” and walking away, the lady
looked over her shoulder for an answer. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
having won a reply in the affirmative, the
lady rapidly hurried to her room.</p>

<p>After supper, as Maud’s mother took her
seat, to which she was shown by a young
man acting as usher, she noticed the parlor
had been lavishly trimmed with boughs of
green. There was also a tiny wood adjoining
the stage, made of small balsam trees.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she remarked to her daughter,
“they went out between the drops and
gathered them.” And then both ladies interestedly
noticed the guests, as one after
the other, with an air of expectancy, entered.</p>

<p>Programmes were passed and eagerly
scanned.</p>

<p>It was indeed a gala night. Had Maud
and her mother known the various performers,
it would have greatly added to
their entertainment, but as it was, they
could not help adding their applause to that
of the others. Even though Maud was a
stranger, the joyous shouts of laughter
proved too contagious to be altogether resisted,
and indeed before the performance
was over, close contact with these merry
people made Maud feel as though she was
one of them, so quickly does one touch of
nature make the whole world kin.</p>

<p>As the programme indicated the different
characters, they were carefully read, and
many ejaculations were overheard, such as:
“Oh, that’s Isabel’s character,” and “Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Carl Adams will be a sight, he’s such a swell,
you know. How did such an exquisite
ever consent to humble himself in this way?”</p>

<p>To Maud and her mother, however, all
were strangers, with the one exception of
the proprietor of the hotel, but they very
soon learned the names of the people about
them. Besides, as Maud’s mother very
truly said, “Without it I am not positive
that I could remember who the different
ones are in the piece, as it is a long time
since I have read the Midsummer Night’s
Dream.” Therefore, while waiting for the
first scene, they read:</p>

<p>As Maud’s mother inquired when in the
seclusion of their own apartments, “Did
you really like it so very much?”</p>

<p>Maud answered laughing, “More than I
can express.”</p>

<p>The following morning it was a question,
“What would be the proper costume for
breakfast?”</p>

<p>From one of their windows they had a
partial view of the lake, but from the other
nothing but tall trees met their eyes. Pines
were in abundance, but there was an occasional
hemlock, spruce, birch and maple.</p>

<p>“It is summer. Would you think that
this white organdy would do?” asked Maud,
and the frock, apparently only a cloud of
Valenciennes lace, was held towards her
mother.</p>

<p>“Do? I am sure I don’t know what is
considered correct for such a wilderness,
but you might not be warm enough. I
fancy it is cold outdoors.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll wear,” said the
young lady presently, for she had a wonderful
conception of color values, and knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
what would look best with her dark eyes,
and also what would produce the most
fetching effect, should she be able to induce
her mother to walk among the trees
after breakfast. “I am going to put on my
crimson piqué, bodice and all,” for she had
several waists that could be worn with the
same skirt, and as her quick eyes looked
over the guests at breakfast, she was not
sorry the decision had been against the
organdy.</p>

<p>“All night my dreams were of the entertainment,”
said Maud, as, sitting opposite
her mother, she tried to pour the cream
into her coffee. “It is almost too thick to
stir. Did you ever see such cream?” she
said.</p>

<p>“I never saw thicker. And this trout is
delicious. It would be singular indeed if I
were won to this place. But, Maud, tell me
about your dream, dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dreamed of Titania and Oberon,
Queen and King of the fairies, you know. I
could see the airy things moving over the
green. It was Midsummer-Night’s Dream
truly, for I dreamed of the pretty piece, and
isn’t this Midsummer?”</p>

<p>“Why, Maud! I fancy you slept well.
Perhaps you’ll be surprised to learn that I
too dreamed of our evening’s pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Surprised! Yes, indeed!” and Maud’s
eyes sought her mother’s. “What part did
you dream about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it is the opening of the second
act, when the fairy replies to Puck,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Over hill, over dale,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thorough bush, thorough brier,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Over park, over pale,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thorough flood, thorough fire,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">I do wander everywhere.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">You remember how it goes, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly; and didn’t that fairy look
lovely? I am sure I shall be glad to
know her. But Puck I am not as sure
about.”</p>

<p>“Could you pass me the rolls, Maud?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, take that one,” and Maud
turned the plate so that her mother could
have a temptingly brown roll.</p>

<p>“And now,” continued her mother, as
she contentedly broke the roll open, “tell
me more about your dream.”</p>

<p>“You know towards the close, Oberon
and Titania entered with their train.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean where Oberon sings,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Though the house gives glimmering light,</div>
<div class="verse">By the dead and drowsy fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Every elf and fairy sprite,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">And so on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, those are the very words. And
didn’t Titania have a sweet voice? I hope
she’ll sing often. I am sure everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
must enjoy listening to her. I thought this
beautiful:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">First rehearse your song by rote,</div>
<div class="verse">To each word a warbling note.</div>
<div class="verse">Hand in hand with fairy grace,</div>
<div class="verse">Will we sing and bless this place.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As Maud said, “bless this place,” the
lady who had welcomed Maud and her
mother the evening before was walking
past their table, and having overheard the
words, she stopped.</p>

<p>“Just what I like to hear.” Then mischievously
looking at Maud’s mother. “But
I did not expect the woods to have won so
much enthusiasm already, did you?”</p>

<p>“No, I did not,” and the mother’s lip unbent
into a sunny smile. “But there is no
telling what we may both say yet.”</p>

<p>“This fish breakfast has been delicious,
and besides everybody looks rested and
cheery.”</p>

<p>“That is just the point; no one can help
being rested, because midnight-oil is unknown
here and how can people help being
cheery, when this bracing air is a tonic;
And besides we have so many delightful
sports. There are to be charades, and rollicking
games, such as Twirl the Platter,
and Going to Jerusalem, this evening, and
to-day there are several things on hand.
One is a driving and riding party. All the
young people, with two chaperones, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
going over to the next hotel to dinner. By
the way, do you ride?”</p>

<p>And Maud, whose face was flushed with
the memory of her many pleasant hours
on horseback, answered, “I could ride almost
forever.”</p>

<p>“Then you are the very young lady we
want,” and turning to Maud’s mother, “I’m
to be one of the chaperones. I’ll promise
to bring her home safe. There is a fine saddle-horse
waiting to be ridden, and——a fine
young man, who is in despair because every
one but himself has a riding companion.
He is a New York lawyer. May I introduce
him?” were her words, as the trio left the
breakfast-room together.</p>

<p>The answer must have been “Yes,” because,
an hour later, one dowager said to another,
“Did you hear that new girl, that
airish creature with the golden hair, and
sleepy-looking dark eyes, who came just
before supper last evening, has gone off
horseback riding with the one we called
‘the dissatisfied young man?’ He seems
to be perfectly satisfied now. I suppose
neither of our daughters was good enough
for him.”</p>

<h2>THE FLOWER-TEST.</h2>


<p>The postman rapped at my door, and
presently the trim little maid brought me a
big square letter on a tray. I knew that
hand. Nobody but Penelope writes in that
scraggly style, plain, too, as a pikestaff, and
easy to read. “Darling Gertrude,” she began,
“I am about to plead for a visit. It
seems a little bit of forever since I saw you
and I want you here in my country house
where we’ll have time to enjoy one another,
talk of the past and present tenses to our
hearts’ content, and perhaps plan a happy
future.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you whom you’ll meet: Mr.
and Mrs. Burkhardt,—you remember that
sweet little girl bride who succeeded so well
in blinding us—at first; dear old General
Bolton, and his youngest brother, who paints
almost as well as he talks; pretty Elsie
Sterling and my cousin Bob. You see I put
them together, but so would you if you
could look out of my window and see them
now. Bob has just mounted Elsie on White
Baron, and now as I write the words he’s
up on Caper and off they go. Well—we’ll
borrow White Baron and Caper later on,
you and I, and perhaps as we canter along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
side by side we may feel ourselves back
again,—back—how many years? Never
mind, we’ll not count. The years have been
happy to us both, I hope.</p>

<p>“But you’ll come—you must not say <i>no</i>,
remember. Cordially your friend,</p>

<div class="sig">“Penelope T. Gerard.”</div>

<p>Indeed I would not say “No.” I would
arrange and rearrange my summer plans to
meet Penelope once more.</p>

<p>It was scarce three years since I last saw
her. She was then a bride of but two
months and I spent three days with her
just as I was leaving for Germany. During
the interval our letters were more or less
frequent, and so in a way we each kept track
of the other and felt as close friends as we
had been since our childhood.</p>

<p>So it was with infinite pleasure I wrote an
acceptance.</p>

<p>“The Maples” is an unpretending rambling
sort of a house, with piazzas, and “corners,”
and nooks where one would least
expect them. There is no rhyme or reason
to the architecture, and an architect
would shake his head in sad consternation.
However, if he were told that three generations
of Gerards had idled their summers
happily away within and without its walls,
and that each owner had added his share to
the original pile, perhaps the exact architect
would turn his critical smile to one of content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and count himself fortunate to be allowed
to enter this abode of happiness.</p>

<p>It was a sunny day when I first drove up
the long maple-lined driveway and there on
the lawn, close to the entrance, was Penelope
making tea and laughing one of her old
merry laughs as the General stood before her.
I suppose he was telling her one of his
funny stories. I don’t know, for of course I
only saw them a moment before the carriage
stopped, and once more Penelope and I were
together.</p>

<p>The General had known us both as girls,
and soon we were talking over old faces and
scenes, and it seemed as though we had
never been parted. The rest of the party
had gone for a long drive and would not be
back until seven o’clock. So we three
talked on and on.</p>

<p>“Oh, it does seem so good to be here,
Pen,” I said, and added, “As I came up the
driveway, the first thing I heard was your
laugh. You know how mamma used to like
to hear you laugh.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember how irrepressible I was.
But, Trudy, you too would have laughed if
you’d heard the General hang me.”</p>

<p>“Hang you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. Don’t you know the game?”
Then seeing my bewilderment, she went on.
“You must learn it. It’s fine for two people.
Especially when one gets short of subjects
to talk about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Here General Bolton threw back his head
and laughed heartily. “Short of subjects to
talk about! I guess Trudy would as soon
believe the Atlantic had gone dry as to
think your nimble tongue was ever still. No,
indeed! On the contrary, Trudy, she was
bound she would make me let out a secret,
and I, old fool, would probably have fallen
into her trap, only she warned me by—but
never mind how she warned me, or even
that will fail me next time. So I hung her.
Yes, I caught her well.” Then with a
chuckle. “Tell her how, Pen, you know
best how, for you know you were <i>hung</i>,
and well hung.” And again he laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s true. But try me again sometime,
or rather, I’ll try you and we’ll see
who does the <i>hanging</i>. No, not now, you
need not look so eager.”</p>

<p>“Bah, you’re afraid.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed I am not. Just now however
I mean to take Gertrude and show her
where her room is. She has been ever so
patient.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, please explain first about
the <i>hanging</i>. It sounds so sanguinary.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is. Now listen and I’ll explain,
and then we’ll go indoors. ‘To hang a
person with a word,’ is the name of the
game. You take any word you like in your
mind and simply mention the number of
letters it has. The other party has to guess,
by letters, without making twelve misses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
If she fails to guess without twelve wrong
guesses, she is <i>hung</i> as I was. That doesn’t
seem very clear to you, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a word and show you. Now,
General, I did not mean to give you your
battle now. But you may have it if you’re
ready.”</p>

<p>“Steady, fire.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Then she whispered to me
the word “Eyelet.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll hang you, General Bolton, with
a word of six letters.”</p>

<p>“Bah, that’s easy. First, I’ll guess
L.”</p>

<p>“Right. It has fourth place.” Then she
explained to me, “You have to tell the
position of the letter.”</p>

<p>“M.”</p>

<p>“Wrong. That’s one. You help me
keep count, Trudy. Remember, twelve
wrong guesses and I’ve hung him.”</p>

<p>“A.”</p>

<p>“Wrong. That makes two.”</p>

<p>“E.”</p>

<p>“Right. First place.”</p>

<p>“I.”</p>

<p>“Wrong. Three.”</p>

<p>“O.”</p>

<p>“Wrong. You see he’s trying the vowels.
How many does that make?”</p>

<p>“Four.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you girls need not look so jubilant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
four doesn’t make much. I’ll guess U,
next.”</p>

<p>“Five,” we both shouted.</p>

<p>“Well, T.”</p>

<p>“Right, and sixth place.”</p>

<p>“An e, an l, and a t. Let me see. Any
n’s in it?”</p>

<p>“No. That makes six. Oh, we have
you, General, that is half the number.”</p>

<p>“The battle is not won yet; no, nor lost
yet. Well, I’ll guess G.”</p>

<p>“Seven.”</p>

<p>He looked down at the grass and
drummed his fingers on his knee, then said,
“D.”</p>

<p>“Eight.”</p>

<p>“An e, an l, and a t. That’s a queer
combination when all the other vowels are
out. Holloa! Is there another e?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Third place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and another l?”</p>

<p>“Nine.”</p>

<p>“I hope this word is in the English language?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. It is English and it is used
to-day, but a generation back it was used
more frequently.”</p>

<p>“A generation back! Bah!” and he
straightened himself and rising strode back
and forth with his hands clasped back of
him. “I have it! That is, I am pretty
certain. Has a y, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes—second place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eyelet!” he shouted. “Bah, you
thought you had me. Well, you almost
did. Those pesky vowels were at fault.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, I’ll hang you yet. I have
another word in mind. But not to-day.
Come, Gertrude. You see it all now, I
guess, and we must hurry in, or Will and
the others will be back before we are ready
for dinner. Good-bye for a time, General.
Look to your guns. I shall be after you
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Breakfast was more than half over, some
mornings later, when in came Bob and
Irving Bolton. A chorus of “Fie, fie,”
greeted them, and Elsie Sterling shook her
fingers threateningly as Bob explained,
“Pen, don’t be hard on a fellow. Irving
and I talked too late, I suppose, last night.
At any rate I know I should never have
turned up this morning only that he yelled
across to me that lunch was most ready.
And then he loitered to help me share the
blame of our lateness. Hey, old fellow?”
and he looked across at Irving as he slid
into the vacant place between Elsie and
Mrs. Burkhardt.</p>

<p>“You are both rascals, both of you,”
growled the General. “Burkhardt and I
have been up hours and have planned the
finest sort of a day for the rest of you ungrateful
ones. Shall we tell them, Burkhardt?”</p>

<p>Before Mr. Burkhardt had a chance to
reply, Penelope interposed, “Let me try
and guess.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mrs. Gerard, but you’ll have
to try twenty questions or some such game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
or you’ll not hit it. It’s a fine scheme.”
And Ned Burkhardt nodded triumphantly
while he put a piece of buttered toast on his
wife’s plate.</p>

<p>“I’ll guess just once, and without the help
of twenty questions either. It’s a picnic.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed the General. “You
overheard, or somebody told you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I did, or perhaps that omnipresent
‘little bird’ chirped it in my ear. But,
at any rate, it’s a fine idea. What say the
rest of you?”</p>

<p>“Just the thing. Fine,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“How shall we go, Will, and where?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s go to Sylvan Grove. It is only
ten miles. Let me see. Two of you can
ride horseback.</p>

<p>“Will you and Irving ride, Gertrude?
And, Burkhardt, you and madame and Elsie
and Bob might take the buckboard, and
we three old fogies—pardon me, General,—will
follow on with the provisions. Will
that suit, Penel?”</p>

<p>“All right. And now let’s get ready.
Can you all start in three quarters of an
hour?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>Promptly we all sallied forth, and it was a
merry party. The air was perfect, and Irving,
Bolton and I cantered on ahead, and
finding ourselves far in advance, we turned
and rode across country for a few miles.</p>

<p>It was a perfect day, and the picnic was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
perfect success. At dinner that night we
voted it as the best day yet.</p>

<p>“Well, to-morrow is the golf tournament,
you know,” said Will, and turning to his
wife, he added, “Didn’t you say there was a
dinner on too?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I nearly forgot. Dear old
Mrs. Preston asked us all to dinner.” Turning
towards me she said, “You remember
at our tea, the day after you came, a white-haired
lady accompanied by her granddaughter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed I do. I think you said she
lives in that gray stone house we passed
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the one. It’s a lovely house
too—and such china! Why, Mrs. Burkhardt,
she has a willow set that would make
your mouth water. Perhaps we’ll see it.”</p>

<p>Then turning swiftly, for dinner was over
and we were just leaving the room, “Listen,
all of you, please. To-morrow night
at Mrs. Preston’s, and next night nowhere.
It is Gertrude’s last night here and let’s
spend it all alone,” and having made her
little speech she slipped her arm around my
waist and we went out together.</p>

<p>We passed through one of the French
windows, out on the piazza, and sat there
late into the night. Snatches of conversation
came to us again and again, and
Mrs. Burkhardt’s sweet soprano as she and
Elsie sang together, while Irving accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
on the mandoline. But we, Penelope
and I, remained alone, each happy in the other.</p>

<p>The last night came, as all “last nights”
must, and with it, “in sympathy with our
mood,” was the General’s courteous construction,
came a heavy, moaning storm.
Will poked the fire and piled on the logs as
though a blizzard were raging without.
Finally, he paused and said, “I guess, Pen,
dear, you may have your wish. No one
will disturb our family serenity this night.”</p>

<p>How cosy it seemed and how happy all
appeared. Elsie and Mrs. Burkhardt, Irving
and Bob were playing checkers in the next
room. Ned and Penelope were talking about
dogs and horses and comparing their relative
intelligence. The General was looking over
some foreign photographs, while Will and I
bestowed our attention on the fire.</p>

<p>“Truly,” spoke General Bolton, “did you
ever get up early enough to see Covent
Garden Market in its glory!”</p>

<p>“Oh, General, do you mean to infer absolute
laziness, or do you mean that the gray
gloom of London would forbid an early
awakening?”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I inferred. Did you
ever go to the market—early?”</p>

<p>“Strange as it may seem to you, I did. I
went one morning to Covent Garden Market,
and early, about six o’clock, with an English
girl. It was a wonderful sight.”</p>

<p>“See,” he interrupted, “it was this picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of a costermonger with the palms and ferns
that made me ask you.”</p>

<p>“It is very natural—the little donkey,
the barrow and all. And how very cheap
the plants and flowers are—why that morning
I bought for sixpence as many moss
roses and buds as I could carry.”</p>

<p>“Gertrude, did you ever see that?” And
Will gave me a printed slip that he had been
searching for in his pocketbook. It was
called the Floral Test.</p>

<p>“No, but isn’t it good? Let’s ask the
others the questions and see who can answer
the most.”</p>

<p>“Come, all you people,” called Will, and
he stepped over to the next room. “Aren’t
you tired of checkers? Gertrude has a new
game.”</p>

<p>When all were seated around expectantly
he said: “Now, Gertrude, you ask the questions
and we’ll reply. It is called,” he explained,
“the Floral Test. She’ll ask questions
and we’ll give answers in the names of
flowers.”</p>

<p>“Tell me the name of a maiden, and the
color of her hair.”</p>

<p>“Maria-gold,” shouted Irving.</p>

<p>“Good for you, old fellow. How did you
know?” questioned Bob.</p>

<p>“O here,” and young Bolton tapped his
forehead significantly.</p>

<p>“What adjective fitted her and what was
her brother’s name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>All were silent until Mrs. Burkhardt timidly
said, “Is it Sweet-William?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Now try this,—What was
his favorite sport in winter?”</p>

<p>“That’s easy. Snowball,” and Bob threw
his handkerchief at Will, who sharply returned
it.</p>

<p>“Ned, what was his favorite instrument?”</p>

<p>“Is it the trumpet?”</p>

<p>“That is right. Can you tell me, Elsie,
at what hour he awoke his father by playing
on it?”</p>

<p>“Four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and what did his father apply to
him?”</p>

<p>“A golden-rod,” two or three shouted.</p>

<p>“What office did his father occupy in the
church?”</p>

<p>All seemed puzzled. Finally Elsie said,
“Was it elder?”</p>

<p>“Right. What was the young man’s
name, and what did he write it with?”</p>

<p>“That is a poser, Trudy. You’ll have to
tell them, I guess,” suggested Will.</p>

<p>“Jonquil, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed the General, while the
others laughed.</p>

<p>“Irving, what candy do you usually
buy?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know,” said Will, “but wait
a moment and I’ll show you some,” and he
went to a closet and brought back a box of
buttercups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what did John do when he popped
the question?”</p>

<p>“Aster,” yelled the General.</p>

<p>“That is correct, General. See if you
can tell what ghastly trophy he offered
her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is easy. A bleeding heart.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did she say as John knelt
before her?”</p>

<p>“Why, Johnny-jump-up, of course.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. You are fine at this game,
General. Can you tell me what minister
married them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack-in-the-Pulpit,” exclaimed Penelope.</p>

<p>“What did she wear in her hair?”</p>

<p>“Bridal-wreath.”</p>

<p>“What flowers bloomed in her cheeks?”</p>

<p>“Roses.”</p>

<p>“What did John say when obliged to
leave her for a time?”</p>

<p>“Forget-me-not.”</p>

<p>“That is all. It is a fine game, Will.
Where did you find it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I came across it in a paper, and I
know Pen likes that sort of thing, so I cut it
out. But I forgot all about it until you two
were talking over Covent Garden and the
early market.”</p>

<p>“I think I can add one to that list of
questions,” and Penelope arose and, drawing
me up by the hand, said, “What flower
should we put in the candle tray at night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poppy,” came the quick reply, and Bob
quoted,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The Rock-a-bye lady</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Hush-a-bye street,</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">From her head to her feet.</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“—— oh, I say, Pen,” he called, as we
were on the stairs, “what shall we all do
when Gertrude leaves us?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that as a Floral Test
question?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I know what I’ll do, but I don’t know
any flower or plant to describe it.”</p>

<p>“Why, Penelope, we’ll all balsam.”</p>

<h2>HOURS WITH THE POETS.</h2>


<p>“Felicia Hemans was an American,
born ‘down East’ somewhere; I think in the
same section Nora Perry hails from,” was
the startling announcement uttered in my
hearing, by a “sweet girl graduate” of so
short time ago as June, 1892.</p>

<p>“Pardon contradiction,” I called from my
end of the library, “but Felicia Hemans
was an Englishwoman, and her birthplace
was Liverpool.”</p>

<p>The surprise the above incident created
caused my own thought to revert to the
honored and beloved poets who have so
lately left us, as well as to the mighty
revered army, from Chaucer down, who
have more or less an abiding-place in our
hearts.</p>

<p>And then followed another thought,—would
it not be a wise use of time for some
of us to study the lives and works of these
poets, the minor as well as the more prominent
ones, and so save ourselves from
similar ludicrous blunders as the one above
given?</p>

<p>And particularly do I appeal to the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
girls just out; but even the busy schoolgirl
would have the opportunity if she would
only systematically arrange her work.
Afternoon classes might be formed, or evening
ones if preferred; the latter would
have the advantages, as then the big brothers
might come. Simple refreshments, too,
would not jar on harmony, but rather tend
to sociability. These could be provided by
the hostess, for the girls should take turns
in having the class meet at each house. It
would also be found to be a benefit to have
a president and secretary for such a class,
or, if an old person could be gotten, popular
and wise enough to take charge, that would
prove still more satisfactory.</p>

<p>It is quite the fashion now to be a member
of a dancing class, why not be a member of
a poets’ class, and so take care of your head
as well as your heels? Indeed, classes are
the “order of the day,” for language, music,
riding, cooking, wood-carving, needlework,
indeed everything, and the young girls or
boys who may read this sketch certainly
want to be into things as well as their
fellows.</p>

<p>In these hours with the poets, take a
different poet for each time the class meets.
Before the close of one meeting decide on
who will be the next one taken up. For
example, will it be Keats, Saxe, Bayard
Taylor, or Jean Ingelow? That settled,
name who will be the one to give a biographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
sketch of the poet. This may be
in the form of an original paper, or read
directly from an encyclopedia. Also name
two or more members to read or recite poems
from the poet under consideration. Discussion
and criticism should be freely allowed,
and unanswerable questions should
be always answered at the next meeting before
entering on the new poet. It would
save time to have the hostess answer the
questions left from the week before, as she
could have numerous books at hand, and of
necessity would be present.</p>

<p>Do not say this is too difficult a task.
Nothing is too difficult for those who
try.</p>

<p>And do not think such study and hours
are unnecessary. If you do, find out how
many of your classmates can at once answer
whom Ben Jonson adopted as his poetical
son? He was a pastoral lyrist, and left behind
him thirteen hundred poems. He was
a bachelor, though he lived to be eighty-four
years of age. He was born at Cheapside,
London, in 1591, and died in 1674, at
Dean Prior, which living was presented to
him, for at times he was very poor. His
name was Robert Herrick.</p>

<p>Or does my reader know that Thomas
Gray was a close student of Dryden, or that
the author of the first important body of
English sonnets was the romantic hero, Sir
Philip Sidney, and that he died when but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
thirty-two years of age, having been conspicuous
at the court of Elizabeth, was a
soldier of great promise, a leading statesman,
and has a prominent place in history?</p>

<h2>“THANK YOU!”</h2>


<p>“I sent her a basket of fruit for Christmas.
The basket was of the finest Chinese straw,
and decorated with handsome pale green
satin ribbon; and the fruit, Bartlett pears,
mandarins, and white grapes; but she has
not acknowledged it by either verbal or
written thanks.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she never received it,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“I know that she did, for my daughter
called one day and recognized the basket,
which stood on the table in the hall through
which she passed.”</p>

<p>“Well, but you know she is a very busy
woman.”</p>

<p>“That is no excuse. People may be ever
so busy, but they should not forget decent
courtesy. Indeed, my experience has been
that the busy people are, oftener than otherwise,
the most polite people. My theory is,
they do not allow themselves to rust in any
direction; duty should be done, and is done.
If an individual cannot take time to thank a
friend for a Christmas gift, next year that
friend may not take time to give one. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
am sure it is not the question of time; it is
the question of knowledge or carelessness.
There are people who really don’t know
enough to be polite; and others know, but
are too indifferent to take the trouble, forgetting
that their conduct reflects most disagreeably
upon themselves. One would
think a kind heart might dictate, if common-sense
did not. But I suppose some
people have neither common-sense nor kindness
of heart.”</p>

<p>Overhearing the above conversation, the
listener was reminded of a similar instance
lately experienced in her own life. A letter
had been written, which had honorably adjusted
a money complication that concerned
the gentleman to whom she wrote and a society
which he represented, but did not concern
or reflect upon the writer in the smallest
degree excepting for the goodwill she
bore her friend, and yet for this same letter
she did not receive one word of thanks—not
even the acknowledgment of its ever having
been received. That it <i>was</i> received
was later proved by a printed report that it
would have been impossible to set in order
without it.</p>

<p>The examples given are by no means rare
and peculiar, but may be duplicated over
and over by every intelligent person. And
in this age of letters, when printed matter
was never so reasonable, and when teachers
and schools may be really had “without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
money and without price,” when lectures on
all topics are inexpensively if not, indeed,
freely given, where is the excuse for knowledge
not to be the power of all? It would
almost seem as if even those indifferently
educated could not help but have learned
to say “thank you,” or to acknowledge by
pen or voice any accommodation, help, or
present.</p>

<p>Blood is sure to tell, and with Emerson
we say that “man is physically as well as
metaphysically a thing of shreds and
patches, borrowed unequally from good
and bad ancestors.” To those of gentle
blood, rudeness would be impossible. If
there are partial lapses of manner with those
looked upon as the refined, the question is
asked, “Where does she get that trait?”
and possibly the answer may be, “Her
great-grandmother.” For thus are the sins
visited upon the children of even the third
and fourth generations. The deportment of
the real gentleman or woman can never be
unpleasantly criticised. They could not be
ungracious, no matter how hard they should
try. If there is ever a question about how
far politeness should extend, err on the side
of too much rather than that of too little.
Have too much manner rather than not
enough. Be too profuse in thanks rather
than too scant and meagre.</p>

<p>When a gift has been received or a courtesy
of any kind shown you, at once acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
it, unless you are too ill so to do,
or a positively important matter prevents.
If it is impossible to write to the one you are
indebted to that day, do it the next. But
as it is so easy for most of us to have good
intentions, do not put off for to-morrow
what should be done to-day.</p>

<p>The note should not be long, but heartily
and pleasantly worded. Some people might
reflect, “I would not tell a falsehood, and
how can I say I like a thing if I do not?” Or,
as happened lately, two boxes of wild flowers
were sent me from California by two little
boys, with a note in one of the boxes containing
the words, “Which flowers got to
you best, Pierre’s or mine?” and I was
obliged to at once put both boxes in the fire.
Should I write of the sweetness of the blossoms
and the purity and beauty of their coloring?
By no means. But I would not
wound the childish hearts by telling of the
condition of the flowers at the time they
were received. Remember the thought
that prompted the gift. Dwell on that
altogether if you will. Send a loving message
to the donors, and they will never
dream you did not like their offering in the
one case or were obliged to burn it in the
other.</p>

<p>After all, remembrance is the sweetest
of all earthly gifts. When the dear ones with
whom we journey are no longer here, we
will miss their gentle ministry. May not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
any one of us then know the bitterness of
remorse, but rather let us hasten to send
abundant, hearty thanks to those who have
taken time to think and care for us!</p>

<h2>A STORY WITHIN A STORY</h2>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">It was the time when lilies blow,</div>
<div class="verse">And clouds are highest up in air,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">that four young people were vivaciously
talking on the front piazza at Aunt Mary’s.</p>

<p>Aunt Mary was everybody’s friend, but
particularly beloved by the nephews and
nieces, of whom this story tells. And her
home, “just the jolliest kind of a place to
visit,” Jo said, as he described beforehand
the expected good times his sister Madeline
with their cousins, Madge and Ernest, were
to have in the week’s vacation given them
for recuperation after the half-yearly examination.</p>

<p>Aunt Mary’s house was in New Jersey;
of course, it was on a farm, for whoever
would think of looking for such fun and
frolic anywhere else? And as all the cousins
came from city homes, and Jo and his
sister from a small flat of a large apartment
house, the freedom of space which the
country had given, added to the bracing air
and sunny, cheerful atmosphere, was a delightful
contrast. But no one would have
thought, though, that Madeline was seventeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
years of age, or that Madge was called
“Miss Propriety” at home, for they would
race over the farm, playing the wildest of
games “like a couple of tomboys,” their
brothers said. But Aunt Mary let them do
exactly as they pleased, and would always
sigh when she would talk of their shut-in
city life, and point to their red cheeks with
great pride, which she assured them came
from living with her. And the boys, too,
had seemed wonderfully benefited by their
running, racing, riding, ball and tennis playing.
Even the hallooing “got plenty of
fresh air in their lungs,” Ernest said, which,
with other things too many to mention, had
been done in this brief holiday.</p>

<p>To-morrow they must start homeward;
and just because they were exhausted with
one and another game, they are, at the
commencement of our story, resting and
talking on Aunt Mary’s front piazza.</p>

<p>Ernest is rubbing his right arm meanwhile,
for he says, “It has pained me dreadfully
ever since that last catch at the ball.”</p>

<p>And Aunt Mary has just joined them,
carrying with her a big tin waiter on which
is a large molasses cake, so fresh that it is yet
hot from the oven, and a four-quart pitcher
of milk, which Bessie, the brown-eyed Alderney,
had given at the morning milking
hour. At sight of their aunt thus laden,
three cheers were laughingly and loudly
given, for if there is one way quicker than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
another to young people’s hearts, perhaps
it is by the way of hot molasses cake and
ice-cold fresh milk, as rich as many city
folks have their cream.</p>

<p>Jo, who was eighteen years old on his
last birthday, is considered the young man
of the party. He has always been a gentleman,
and he at once rushed to the sitting-room
for his aunt’s favorite rocking-chair.
As Ernest has already disposed of the tray
by putting it on a spruce-bark covered table
which stands for all sorts of convenient purposes
on the piazza, Aunt Mary is comfortably
placed in her easy-chair before she realizes
that Jo had gone for it. “Oh, what
delicious cake!” “How kind you are!”
“I must have another glass of that milk.”
“Isn’t this lots better than being in school?”
etc., were the pleasing comments and ejaculations
which any stranger might have
heard passing on the other side of the road
from the house, or, indeed, a quarter of a
mile beyond it.</p>

<p>After awhile, however, the eating and
drinking were over, and “What shall we
do now?” was the question. “I’m tired
out, for one,” said Ernest, and “I for another,”
continued Madge; “still, these are
our last hours and we must do something;
we cannot afford to lose a moment. Aunt
Mary, you tell us what to do.”</p>

<p>“Will you promise to do what I tell
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“We will,” answered Madeline. “Of
course we will,” continued Ernest; “a likely
thing we could say no, now, of all times,
after the way this cake and milk have disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s agreed, then,” said Aunt Mary.
“I want you to entertain me awhile by
telling a story.”</p>

<p>“A story! How? We don’t exactly
understand, do we?” asked Jo, looking at
one and another perplexed face.</p>

<p>“The story,” answered Aunt Mary, “must
be altogether, ‘made up,’ as Madge would
say. It must be divided in four chapters or
parts, as nearly equal in length as is possible.
Jo can begin it, and, after talking, say
for two minutes, Madge must follow, then
Ernest and Madeline will close.”</p>

<p>These words were followed with whistles
from the boys, and “Oh, my!” from the
girls, to all of which Aunt Mary said,
“You promised, and of course you will do
it. And when the story is told, we will all
drive over to Bear’s Gulch, and that will
take the remainder of the afternoon.”</p>

<p>These words were followed by a halt and
sighs. “But it would be a burning shame,”
said Madeline, “not to please Aunt Mary;
besides, of course, we can do it. We can
do anything, if we try.”</p>

<p>“So say we all of us; so say we all,”
sang Ernest.</p>

<p>And Aunt Mary laughingly replied, “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
sooner the story is started, the sooner it is
through, and the sooner it is through, the
sooner we have the drive.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I’m the starter, here goes!”
said Jo.</p>

<p>“And,” interrupted his aunt, “when
your time is up I’ll call Madge’s name, and
so on. Don’t let us have any breaks. Tell
me a story just as smoothly as if you were
reading it from a book. Now, Jo.”</p>

<p>“My title is, ‘The Adventures of an Irish
Setter.’ When Ned Armstrong was so small a
boy that he yet wore knickerbockers, he received
a short visit from his cousin William
Adams. He, too, was a little boy and was
often called ‘Sweet William,’ on account
of his sunny disposition, for, notwithstanding
he was sole heir to great wealth, being
the only child of rich parents, rich enough
to count their wealth by many millions
of dollars,—he was neither selfish, exacting,
nor in any way disagreeable, thereby an
example to some grown-up people we have
met. When William came on this visit, he
brought with him a large, well-trained dog.
He was a magnificent fellow, and Ned, his
cousin, was as amazed as he was pleased to
find that the dog was a present to himself
from William’s father, his Uncle Ned, after
whom he was named. This uncle had long
known he must sometime part with Moselle;
he had been his own from the time
Moselle was a puppy but two months old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
The reason for the separation of master and
dog was the giving up of housekeeping for
life in a hotel, as Aunt Cornelia, Uncle Ned’s
wife, was now too much of an invalid to continue
caring for a house, even with the assistance
of a housekeeper, of whom she had tried
many, and dogs are among the ‘not allowed’
in hotels. So, Uncle Ned, remembering his
little nephew in the country, and knowing
how he would prize and kindly treat his old
pet and friend, sent Moselle by his son
William to him. This gift made Ned, however,
nearly crazy with delight, and the old
gardener often feared the results to his
flower beds after the races which Ned and
Moselle would take over them. Indeed the
dog was not to blame if he forgot many of
his well-trained ways, country life with
the little boy was so ungoverned by comparison
with what it had been with his staid,
but kind old master.</p>

<p>“One day, five months after Moselle had
changed his home, Ned was missing. No
one knew where the child had gone. He
did not have a regular nurse; but an old
colored servant called Tamar had been in
the family many years, and she, with other
duties, was supposed to keep an eye on
this child. But Tamar had been negligent
this time. Ned was missing. The big
garden was searched everywhere, thinking
possibly he had fallen asleep under some
of the rose or berry bushes, but Ned was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in the garden. Strangely enough, as the
boy and dog were counted inseparable,
Moselle was all right and contentedly sunning
himself on a pansy bed, which was a
favorite place of his, though often scolded
and chased away for thus flattening the
beautiful flowers——”</p>

<p>“Madge, it is your time.”</p>

<p>“As Ned was not found in the garden,
the next place to look was all over the house,
while the cry of ‘Ned! Ned!’ was heard
in every room and from several windows,
for as one after another looked they would
throw up a window-sash, thinking Ned
must be somewhere outside in the grounds
and would surely hear them call, and they
would hear his voice in answer, even if they
did not see him. But it was all in vain.
Ned could neither be seen nor heard, and
his mother and sister Mary, a girl of twelve
years old, who were the only ones of the
family then at home, finally cried with fright
and anxiety. But their fright was of short
duration, for, before an hour had passed,
Ned was back perfectly safe, without scratch
or injury, and having the rested dewy look
to his eyes which all children have who
have lately woke from sleep.</p>

<p>“It was Isaac, the stableman, who found
him. No one ever could really explain
why Moselle was not with him at the time,
but the child had wandered alone into the stable,
and the man passing in and out had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
noticed him, who, probably tired with play,
had fallen asleep on the hay. While thus
asleep, Isaac had closed the stable door and
fastened it, preparatory to a three miles’ drive
to the flour mill. On his return with the
meal, the clatter connected with the moving
of the stable door and getting the horses
back had wakened the child, who came hurriedly
out, rubbing his eyes as he ran,
and calling at the top of his lungs for Moselle,
not knowing others had as loudly been calling
for him. But Moselle did not answer.
There was no running, jumping and wagging
of the tail from his dog-friend, for Moselle
was now the missing one. In the
gladness of Ned’s being found, neither Mrs.
Armstrong, nor Mary, nor, indeed, any of
the servants, had given the dog a thought,
and it was not until Ned refused to be comforted
that one of the help slowly said,
‘There was a poor old soldier here this
morning, just at the time Isaac came home
with the meal. I thought, perhaps, Isaac
had given him a lift up. He asked for a
cup of coffee, but I had none made, and
didn’t want to take the trouble to make any,
so I gave him a couple of slices of bread
with apple-sauce between. I reckon he’s
made way with the dog, the mean, contemptible
wretch!’</p>

<p>“And he had. Moselle was already miles
away from the house of little Ned Armstrong,
and his companion was the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
poorly-clad half-sick looking soldier that
the housemaid had given the apple-sauce
sandwich to that morning. The dog was
prevented from running home by a strong
cord fastened around his neck at one end
and the other end firmly clutched by the
man’s hand, and both dog and man had
had several helps over the road, as their
rested-looking condition proved. That
night, in the city of Wilmington, North
Carolina, the soldier sold the dog for twenty-three
dollars to a handsome young army
officer, at present stationed at Old Point
Comfort, but who had a three days’ leave of
absence to visit a sick relative at Wilmington.
The dog and his new master had
already started for ‘Old Point’ when the
officer suddenly remembered—”</p>

<p>“Ernest, your time now.”</p>

<p>“That he had forgotten to ask the dog’s
name, and, as he could not take time to
hunt the man up from whom he had bought
the dog, he decided to christen him Duke.</p>

<p>“It was the month of March, and the
Hygeia Hotel was a gay scene of life and
beauty. Among the guests was a charming
young woman, talented and rich, but
also very lame. She could not walk without
the aid of a crutch; but, notwithstanding
this detraction, she fascinated everybody
by her lovely manner and cheerful,
sunny disposition. The gentleman who
had bought Moselle, now called Duke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
daily dined at the Hygeia, and in a particularly
fortunate time was presented to the
lame lady. He was, therefore, the envy
of all the unmarried army officers who,
with every one else, would delight in thinking
of her as their friend. The young lady
admired Duke very much, and often petted
and caressed him, and the dog seemed
proud and pleased to be in her company.
However, the time came for the lame lady
to return to her home in New York, and
the dog was left alone with his master,
though I might add, not alone, for everybody
living at the ‘Point’ seemed to know
Duke and would always praise his beauty.
One old gentleman offered two hundred
dollars for him once, but it was refused, his
owner saying, ‘I will never sell Duke,
though some day I may be tempted to give
him away.’ Duke was taught many tricks
while at the Fortress, among others, to
carry letters. These he would hold in his
mouth, but would neither tear them with
his teeth, nor wet them with his tongue.
He was also taught to ‘say his prayers,’
which he always did kneeling on a wooden
chair, with his head resting with closed
eyes on the back. When ‘Amen’ was said
this was the signal to jump over the chair-back
and shake himself as if pleased to
have prayer-time over. One day, as the
mail was being distributed, Duke, as was
his wont, was standing near, and one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
officers putting a letter in the dog’s mouth,
said: ‘Take that to your master. It’s from
his friend, the lame lady.’ This the officer
meant for a joke, but it was really true, and,
as the letter concerned Duke, we will insert
it here:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. G——</span>:</p>

<p>“‘According to promise, I write
you the result of the operation, which I am
sure you will be glad to learn is a complete
success. My physicians say if I will have
patience for another month I will then walk
as well as anybody. Please give Duke an
extra pat on my account, and whenever you
feel constrained to part with him, remember</p>

<div class="sig"><span style="margin-right: 4em;">“‘Your friend</span><br />“‘<span class="smcap">Pauline Jerome</span>.’</div></div>

<p>“That settles it!” exclaimed Duke’s
master. ‘I learned last night I was soon
to be sent to California, and I at once
decided my good dog and I must separate.
And now that he can have so kind a mistress,
and I have this opportunity to win
the gratitude of my lovely friend, what a
fool I would be to hesitate longer. On my
way to California, I will arrange to pass
through New York City, and will then personally
give my dog to Miss Jerome.’”</p>

<p>“Madeline, will you finish the story?”</p>

<p>“Six months have now passed since Duke
exchanged his home at Fortress Monroe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
for the luxurious apartments of his beautiful
mistress. The dog is constantly tended
with the greatest care, groomed as tenderly
as if made of human flesh. He sleeps in
my lady’s room and seems truly aristocratic
with his lordly bearing. His baby-blue
satin ribbon bow, knotted into the solid
gold collar, which bears his name and
address, a Christmas gift from his mistress,
causes him to appear what indeed he has
become—almost spoiled with good fortune.</p>

<p>“But what a change a few short hours
can make! That night there was a cry of
‘Fire!’ My! the alarm and panic it raised!
for the fire was not noticed until there was
so much flame and smoke that it was with
the utmost difficulty the inmates of the
house escaped with their lives. Nothing
else was saved. Miss Jerome calling to a
fireman, said: ‘Take care of my dog, and
I will pay you well.’ The man, catching
the dog harshly by the collar, fairly dragged
him out of the burning building, for Duke
seemed dazed with smoke and fright. But,
on reaching the street, the dog was entirely
beyond control, and, with wonderful strength
freed himself from the man’s grasp, strong
as it was, and dashed down the street. Miss
Jerome offered at different times large rewards
for his return; but it was useless,
Duke and his mistress were never again to
meet, he was as lost to her as if he had
never existed. Several months passed, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the fire, and the dog once more found
friends, a home, and his old name, Moselle.
Peculiar events happen in life, and few more
so than the following. Mr. and Mrs. Adams
of whom this story first told, had gone to
the South of France, hoping to recover the
health of Mrs. Adams, on whose account it
will be remembered the valued dog had to
be parted with. They were accompanied
by Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong and their children,
Ned and May. The older people of
this party were one morning talking on the
lawn connected with the Hôtel de Grace,
when Ned and May suddenly burst upon
them accompanied by a large dog, who was
jumping and tearing around as if wild with
joy. Seeing Mr. Adams, he left the children,
and, jumping on his lap, laid his head
on his shoulder and moaned and actually
seemed to weep with gladness. ‘This is
Moselle, Moselle!’ shouted Ned; ‘we saw
him with an old fiddler out here on the road.
I thought he looked like my dear old dog,
though he is so thin and starved looking,
and I called “Moselle,” and you should
have seen him run. Those long legs of
his fairly raced to reach me. Indeed, he
knocked me down. He was too happy to
behave, wasn’t you, Moselle?’ and Ned
tenderly smoothed his beautiful head, which
he yet kept on his old master’s shoulder, as
though they must never be separated again,
while his tender brown eyes seemed to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of affectionate content. The family never
again parted with Moselle until he died,
which sad event occurred towards the close
of the same year. The dog’s exposures and
privations after the fire, during his varied
life, seemed to have weakened and injured
him to such an extent that, though tender
care was constantly lavished, it came too
late. All that Mr. Adams ever learned of
Moselle’s history, he heard from the fiddler,
who had bought him from an old woman,
who said he belonged to her son, and that
they had had nothing but bad luck since the
dog was theirs, and she would be glad to
get rid of him at any price. The fiddler
thought the son had stolen the dog, and, as
he was himself having bad fortune, he determined
to leave America and return to his
own country, and had brought the dog over
the sea, thinking in that way if there was
any wrong dealing connected with the dog
he would never be discovered. ‘But,’ said
the old fiddler, gravely shaking his head,
‘I’ve always heard “wrong will out,” and
I’m thankful to dispose of him for so liberal
a compensation as you have so kindly made
me.’ With these words, the fiddler folded
his money over, thrust it in his pocket and
walked away.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for such an entertaining
story,” said Aunt Mary; “and now we will
have our promised drive.”</p>

<h2>ORRIN THE BOOTBLACK.</h2>


<p>“Shine, shine, shine!” the cry was as
earnest as it was pitiful. I rose from my
seat in the cabin of the Fulton Ferry boat,
for I was crossing from Brooklyn to New
York at the time, and found the boy; one
glance into his honest blue eyes did the
rest.</p>

<p>I at once gave him my boots to blacken,
regardless of the opinion of my man Dennis,
that he had put on them an extra polish
that morning, and, while the almost baby
hand continued to shine them into as dazzling
a glare as blackened boots could
reach, I asked him his name, and, giving
him my card, told him to call on me that
evening at seven o’clock.</p>

<p>“Mr. Adams, you surely do not mean me
to understand that your protégé, who to-night
delivered the valedictory address in
this honored college, and the bootblack are
one and the same?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>The above conversation was between the
President of the college and the senior member
of the Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>“Yes; he is the same, and yet not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
same, because then he was such a sad little
fellow, and now he is full of jokes and wholesome
pranks, a merry wit that gladdens my
old days, and almost makes a boy of me
again. At one time, though, I thought he
would never laugh; it was such an apology
for a smile that I first saw cross his prematurely
wizened face. But how long ago it
now seems! Let me see,” thoughtfully
counting one, two, three on his fingers,
“why, it must be twelve years since then.
How time flies!”</p>

<p>“Yes, time always does fly, when we
are busy and happy. But are you aware
that your Orrin is one of our youngest men?
He gave his age as twenty-two!”</p>

<p>“Quite correct.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am confounded at your information.
I am as curious as I am interested.
Would you mind some time telling me the
rest of the boy’s story?”</p>

<p>“Not at all; why not spend to-morrow
evening with me? You know we sail Saturday
for the continent, and after that our
movements are uncertain. Orrin has worked
hard, and I have promised him this treat,
and, though he does not know it, I am
contemplating leaving him at Oxford for
a year or two. By the way, I would like
your opinion as to that. But one thing is
sure—if he stays in England, I stay too. I
could not put the ocean between us. You
cannot imagine how my heart holds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
boy; so, if you really want to hear my
chap’s story, you would better come to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p>“I will come.”</p>

<p>It was evening, and, when the two men
were comfortably seated in Mr. Adams’
library, the following was told.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams prefaced the recital with the
words: “I will photograph Orrin as he first
appeared in my home, and then, as nearly
as my memory can recall our conversation,
I will give it. Twelve years ago, about
seven o’clock in the evening, a maid told
me that a small poorly-clad lad, with a box
under his arm, was asking to see me. He
had entered by the lower door. I directed
her to bring him to me, and, strangely
enough, in my comfortable lounging-chair,
with the evening paper for companion, I
had entirely forgotten the engagement I had
made, but the girl’s words instantly recalled
all, and, a few moments later, I was addressing
him. His manner was neither shy
nor bold. He appeared neither surprised
nor bewildered. I did not note the confused
air, which I could reasonably expect. He
met my gaze with the honest, frank look
that I first noticed, but he seemed sad, even
painfully. He was such a small boy. He
evidently was what is so rarely found—a
gentleman. I almost exclaimed as he stood
in the doorway, for I noticed the way he
held his cap; Beau Brummell in his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
happy days could not have done better, and
the bow with which he answered my ‘good
evening,’ as well as the response to my asking
him to take a chair, made me say to
myself, ‘Adams, you must look out, or this
little bootblack will leave you leagues rearward
in the manner question!’ His hair
was dark, very glossy, and slightly curly.
His face and hands almost shone with cleanliness.
I especially noticed his nails, and,
knowing his business, was surprised to find
that they, also, were quite clean. His
height was decidedly small for his age (he
did not really seem to grow much until he
was about seventeen years old, and then
how he shot up! he is just six feet tall
now); his clothes were not patched, but
threadbare and ragged. The material was
fine. His trousers only came to his knees,
and both shoes and stockings were visibly
the worse for wear. He was not a pretty
boy, but a manly-looking little fellow. His
complexion was fair, but pallid; indeed,
the boy wore a starved, pinched look. His
jacket, which was buttoned with brass buttons
to the neck, hung on him, as if he had
grown thinner since it was made. So much
for my photograph. Now for our conversation,
which will give you a better idea of
the boy, than if only using my own words.</p>

<p>“‘Good evening, my little man.’</p>

<p>“‘Good evening, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘You blackened my boots so well this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
morning, I thought I would like to talk with
you about your business to-night.’</p>

<p>“‘Thank you, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘How long have you been a bootblack?’</p>

<p>“‘Seven weeks.’</p>

<p>“‘Have you made much money?’</p>

<p>“‘I make more now than at first, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘How much is the most you have made
a week?’</p>

<p>“‘Last week, sir, I made ninety-five
cents.’</p>

<p>“‘How much is the least you ever
made?’</p>

<p>“‘Fifteen, sir; that was my first week,
when I was new in the business.’</p>

<p>“‘You live with your parents, I suppose?’</p>

<p>“‘No, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t live with your parents? Whom
do you live with?’</p>

<p>“‘With myself.’</p>

<p>“‘You, a little midget like you, live by
yourself! Where do you sleep?’</p>

<p>“‘Wherever I can find a place.’</p>

<p>“‘Where did you sleep last night?’</p>

<p>“‘You won’t tell, sir, if I tell you?’</p>

<p>“‘No.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’ve slept for three nights, now,
in a covered wagon. It has been left outside,
and, some way, no one has ever seen
me crawl into it. Please don’t tell any one,
sir. I really don’t hurt the wagon.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘But why don’t you go home? Do
your parents drink?’</p>

<p>“‘I have no home, sir; my parents are
dead; they are both in heaven.’ And then
the little hands hastily undid the few top
buttons of his jacket, and untied a black
shoe lace which served as a chain. Then,
stepping nervously towards me, he said;
‘Would you like to see mamma’s picture?’</p>

<p>“I tell you what, sir, this action, united
to the boy’s words, unmanned me. ‘John
Adams,’ I asked myself, ‘you’ll befriend
this boy?’ And John Adams answered, ‘I
will.’</p>

<p>“The picture was painted on porcelain,
a medallion resting on dark blue velvet;
the whole was framed in a band of narrow
gold. The woman was a blonde, delicate
looking, but very beautiful. She had an intellectual
face, and seemed of good birth.
In age about twenty-five years.</p>

<p>“‘Has your mother been dead long?’ I
next asked.</p>

<p>“‘She died when I was born, and I am
ten years old. Papa gave me her picture,
and I always wear it. I would starve, sir,
but I would never part from it.’ I am sure
the boy has it on now, but I would not like
to ask him to show it to you. He is sensitive,
and I would not risk hurting him.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, I would not have you, if
you were ever so willing. And what more,
Mr. Adams? It is well I did not know of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
this while he was in college; I am afraid I
should have spoiled him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I asked him if he had brothers or
sisters. His reply was—</p>

<p>“‘I had one brother; he died a year ago.’</p>

<p>“‘How long since your father died?’</p>

<p>“‘Eight weeks, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘And you started at the boot-blacking
business one week later?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘What was your father’s business?’</p>

<p>“‘When he was in business, he was a
stockbroker.’</p>

<p>“‘A stockbroker!’ I exclaimed, although
I was positive before, judging from his
mother’s picture, that he was born above
his present position. ‘And you say there
was a time when your father was not in
business. How long ago was that?’</p>

<p>“‘The last two years of his life, after he
became blind.’</p>

<p>“‘Tell me all about it, my good boy.’</p>

<p>“‘My father, sir, must have made a great
deal of money; we lived in such a handsome
house.’</p>

<p>“‘As handsome as this?’</p>

<p>“Looking around before he replied,—</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘You say your mother was dead. Who,
then, kept house for you?’</p>

<p>“‘Mrs. Prentiss, our housekeeper. I had
a nurse first, Nurse Ann, and when I got
to be a big boy, I had a governess. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
taught me to read, write, and all I know.
I have never been to school. We had several
servants, and my father kept horses.
It was the house in which mamma died,
and everything, papa said, must be as she
kept house. But, one day, I know not how
it happened, my father lost a great deal of
money, and a lot of strange people came to
the house, and almost all of our beautiful
things were sold. All the servants left but
one, and my governess. Papa and I lived
then in a few rooms. I used to hear papa
talk about his eyes, at that time, and one
day he went to see a doctor about them.
When he came back he told me: ‘My son,
I am going to be blind,’ and then explained
to me exactly what that meant. He told
me that the reason he would be blind was
because he had used too much tobacco.
My father smoked a great many cigars
every day, and sometimes a pipe. He
chewed tobacco too. I felt frightened when
I heard all of this, and I remember I cried
and papa comforted me. He afterwards
asked me to repeat these words after him.
‘My papa was blind. His optic nerves
were hurt because he used too much tobacco.
I will never smoke or chew.’ My
papa had me repeat these words until I knew
them perfectly, and then I said them once
every day to him until he died. I say them
every day to myself now. My papa became
blind very soon after we left our home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and about six months before he died he was
sick most of the time. My governess left
one day, and then I had no more lessons.
And almost every day our things would be
sold, until, when papa died, we had most
nothing left. About a week after he was
buried, some men came to our rooms, and
then our girl left, and the men told me I
must go too. I could not live there any
more. They gave me my clothes, and one
of the men gave me a dollar. I cried so
hard that another man said he would take
me home with him, and I could stay two
or three nights at his house until I could get
some work and make money for myself.
That was why I became a bootblack.
This man told me it was a good business,
and, because I was so little and did not
know what to do, the man and his wife made
me a present of my outfit and told me
to watch other bootblacks and cry out:
“Shine, shine,” and so get business. The
man gave me his boots to black while I
stopped at the house and that taught me the
way, for I never had blackened boots before.
I stayed with these kind people for
one week, and since then I have taken care
of myself.’</p>

<p>“‘Have you no relations?’</p>

<p>“‘None I have ever seen. The day before
papa died, he told me I was soon to be
all alone in the world, that I had no relatives,
and then he said: “Your relatives are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
all dead, my son, or dead to you.” That is
all I know, sir.’</p>

<p>“My heart ached for the child as he finished,
and I thought, let the consequence be
what it would, he should not leave my house
that night. I asked him his name.</p>

<p>“‘Orrin Thorndyke,’ was the reply.</p>

<p>“I told him he was to remain overnight
with me, and that to-morrow I would investigate
his story. This he readily did. He
seemed to be satisfied to do exactly as he
was told; he had evidently not yet gotten
away from the manner of obeying his father.
I think I told you he was prematurely old;
his strange life had made him so. That
night I scarcely slept, so full of plans was I
for the future. As you know, I have always
been a bachelor with plenty of money and
no relatives who will ever need help through
me. Before morning I decided that, if on
investigation I found the bootblack’s story
correct, I would at once adopt him and do
for him as I would for an only son. This I
have conscientiously tried to do, and, coming
in and out of this house as the friend
you are, I trust you think I have done
right.”</p>

<p>“You certainly have.”</p>

<p>“I have noticed your admiration for my
boy, and I have been very glad of it; and
how well I remember the first time you saw
him! You said I was to be congratulated
in having for my protégé such a manly little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
fellow, and then you added, ‘Blood is sure,
Adams, and I give up judging forever after,
if good blood is not in this boy’s veins.’
Of course, when the child became mine, I
wanted him to bear my name, but you
never knew before that the Orrin Thorndyke
part was his own. Some way, I could not
ask him to part with it altogether, and so I
had mine simply added.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a man you are; it takes time
to know you, Adams. And at last, I have
found out why you so suddenly gave up
smoking.”</p>

<p>“That is a fact. How could I smoke
with that child’s story running not only in
my ears, but through my heart? But what
do you think of Orrin smoking three cigars
every day!”</p>

<p>“Surely, you are joking!”</p>

<p>“No; I will tell you how he does it.
When he was fourteen years of age, I gave
him a monthly allowance, because I wished
him to early learn the management of
money. One day, shortly after, he came to
me with the question, would I permit him
to set aside the value of three five-cent
cigars a day, and when the amount would
reach five dollars he desired to put it in the
bank and so open a smoking account. He
also said he would regularly add to this
amount as he could accumulate five dollars,
and that he would not withdraw the money,
but allow it to increase both principal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
interest until he was thirty years of age, at
which time he and I could decide what
would be done with it. This I readily agreed
to do. And now that he has been ‘smoking,’
as he puts it, three five-cent cigars
every day for eight years, the amount already
in the bank, at four per cent. interest,
is not a small one. Why, in the first year,
without interest, he saved nearly fifty-five
dollars!”</p>

<p>“If only I had tried that scheme when I
was fourteen years old, I would be a rich
man now,” replied the President; “however,
it is not yet too late to start the plan
with my grandchildren.”</p>

<h2>BREAKFAST-TABLE DECORATION.</h2>


<p>“Mabel!”</p>

<p>“Well, mamma!”</p>

<p>“Come to breakfast, dearie.” The call
was given through the wide lattice which
opened on the garden. And at once the
little girl obeyed the summons.</p>

<p>And what a charming picture was given
when the child presented herself in the half-open
doorway, with her big blue eyes,
the blue of the sky overhead, cheeks that
rivalled the peach blossom’s rich redness,
and lips wide parted, with the merry laugh
that rippled over and over the upturned face;
for at that moment she was bubbling beyond
control with mischief and sparkle, partly on
account of the buoyancy of the early morning
atmosphere, but mostly because of the raid
she had made on the morning-glory vines,
as her laden hands and arms could testify.</p>

<p>“I haven’t struck the right combination
yet,” were her mother’s words, at the same
time touching a majolica dish of flowers that
served as ornament for the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I have!</i> An idea has just sprung on
me, seized me, as it were! Stand still where
you are, little sister, until Tom comes back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
again,” and then away the boy flew, in his
clumsy energy tripping over an ottoman
that was always at Mabel’s place at table,
because she was not yet tall enough to put
her feet on the floor.</p>

<p>It seemed but a second when he returned
with a cut-glass bowl in his hands, filled
within one-third of the top with fresh, cold
water; and with an air of triumph he removed
the majolica dish, depositing the bowl
in its stead.</p>

<p>Then, going to the little girl, who had
stood motionless in obedience to her big
brother’s command, and with the words,
“Let Tom have some of your pretty
flowers,” he took first one and then another.
The color values, as she held the morning-glories,
appealed to him, there was such richness
of reds, purples, lavenders and white,
with their many intermediate shades, which
blended softly with the green leaves, vines
and tendrils. When he had taken enough
to fill, not crowd the bowl, there were many
exclamations of satisfaction, for all was
harmony. The white tablecloth was a fitting
background to the variety of color, and
the delicate, graceful flowers gave such a
pleasant welcome at this first meal of the new
day.</p>

<p>Morning-glories should be oftener used
for the breakfast-table. Try what you can
do with them, boys and girls, and thus give
a pleasant surprise to your mother. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
pretty table decoration would be to plant
woodland vines, and also ferns, oxalis, and
pretty wild grasses in an ornamental piece
of earthenware, one that would add beauty
to the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Take such a piece to the country with you,
and remember to fill it with forest mould before
you put in the woodland plants; it will
be most pleasing, and prove a joy all winter
if you will properly water it; that is, keep it
wet, not soggy.</p>

<h2>HOW THEY PLANTED THE NASTURTIUMS.</h2>


<p>Such a clamor of voices reached grandma’s
ears that her first thought was that the children
must have the garden, at the very least,
half filled with their schoolmates. But when
the old lady rose from her big armchair to
take a sharp look around from the window,
she was amazed to learn that all the confusion
was made by her two happy, healthy
grandchildren Margaret and Marshall, and
they were as busy as could be, planting and
fussing over nasturtium plants.</p>

<p>“See us, grandma,” were the pleasant if
imperative words when they saw their
grandmother with her head stretched out as
far as possible, looking first one way and
then another.</p>

<p>“See you? Well, I should say I did, and
what are you doing with that old umbrella
frame, Marshall?” was the questioning response.</p>

<p>“Getting ready for our nasturtiums,” and
the boy tossed his head laughingly towards
a large quantity of the golden brown blossoms,
digging energetically all the while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
though, as if moments were more precious
than he could tell.</p>

<p>As grandma was anxious to learn all about
the planting, first Marshall and then Margaret
told her just what they were about to
do. The gardener at the Jenkins place explained
what he did. “And I never saw
nasturtiums look as pretty before,” said
Margaret, with a sedate shake of her head.
“Besides, it is an altogether new idea, not
the old sort of a thing that everybody knows.
It commences by planting an umbrella
frame, putting the handle deep enough down
not to break off with the first strong wind,
or with the weight of vines, either, in case
they should grow a trifle heavier on one
side than the other, though, of course, this
we will try to prevent. The umbrella should
not be put in a corner, but in an open bed,
where people can walk all around it. This
frame of ours has eight sticks, and at each
one we will plant a root. And we are going
to plant two at the handle, one on
either side, and not close enough to crowd
each other. As the vines grow, they will
be trained up the handle and along the sticks,
making the effect of a diminutive tent, and
while this old frame is rather an ungainly
sight at present, in a few weeks the bed will
be simply gorgeous.</p>

<p>“Oh, they are so pretty!” Margaret continued,
lightly and fondly touching the
bright flowers, “such a variety of shades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
yellow, orange, even to a deep brown, and
the vine is willing to wind any way we will;
it is naturally graceful, with just enough
foliage and not too much. Why, the old
frame will be the prettiest thing in all the
country around.”</p>

<p>“I only hope our neighbors will not
watch and try the same thing for themselves,”
was Marshall’s interjection.</p>

<p>“They probably will not before next
summer,” was grandma’s assuring comment,
“and then your nasturtium umbrella would
be one year old.”</p>

<h2>A GARDEN PARTY.</h2>


<p>Dinners, receptions, and concerts have
been attended through the winter until
everybody is tired of the old routine; but entertainment
which is associated with trees,
flowers, gorgeous sunsets, out-of-door life,
touches the heart and makes of every such
occasion a real joy.</p>

<p>How shall we give a <i>fête champêtre?</i></p>

<p>A lawn is a necessity, and should the
trees not prove sufficiently exclusive, surround
the grounds with canvas. The canvas
may be concealed with boughs of
green, running vines, flags, banners, or
anything that will lessen its ugliness. The
entire grounds must be decorated. Japanese
lanterns might be used freely; several
hundreds of them will be required, as they
should be liberally scattered everywhere—not
only in the grounds, on the trees or
canvas serving as fence, but on the piazzas
of the house.</p>

<p>A good orchestra should be hidden behind
a clump of balsam or other bushy
trees. The leader should be untiring in his
efforts to give enough and desirable music.
If ballads are sung, the orchestra leader is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
responsible for the accompaniment, and he
is equally responsible for the dances, should
such be given. The air should be filled
with music, but to the pleasure and not the
annoyance of guests.</p>

<p>Conversation and music are always important
factors of entertainment; but to
these an extravaganza may be added, or a
play—for example, the whole or part of <i>As
You Like It</i>, or <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>.</p>

<p>Should <i>As You Like It</i> be given, screen a
section of the lawn to represent the Duke’s
palace. A conversation-room may readily
be arranged. Remove one or more screens
and see a room, the ceiling of which would
be the sky; the side walls folding screens,
which may be adjusted to any shape and
size; the floor would be the grass covered
with rugs. On these rugs stand a few
chairs, a couch, and a small table. With
such surroundings, altogether at home would
Celia seem, while she would say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Why, cousin; why Rosalind;—</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Cupid have mercy!—Not a word?”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The many songs, especially “Under the
Greenwood tree” and “What shall He have
that killed the Deer?” would prove very
appropriate in the forest of Arden environment,
and the trees would be quite in place
for the love-verses of Orlando.</p>

<p>Or the guests might be served with a literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
salad. Paste or draw pictures on cards
to illustrate the title of a book, and give one
to each person. Whoever shall make a
correct guess without assistance within fifteen
minutes may be presented with a wreath
of laurel. This may be worn on the head or
carried on the arm.</p>

<p>Sometimes a <i>fête champêtre</i> is given for
sweet charity. It then assumes a different
phase, as booths, chalets, or tents are erected,
within which saleable articles are offered.
An effective fête might be given in athletic
grounds, which should be noticeably gay
with streamers of bunting and little and
big flags. At such a fête a large orchestra
should play the entire afternoon.</p>

<p>It would be very attractive if those in
charge of the chalets would represent milkmaids,
as this allows picturesque apparel.
The young ladies might go bareheaded, or
wear a gay handkerchief coquettishly knotted
under their braids or curls, or cover
their heads altogether by donning the new
lawn sunbonnet, which is such a dainty
feature of this summer’s outing.</p>

<p>The chalets should be small lean-tos, their
roofs tilting towards the back and resting on
four poles, one at each corner. These chalets
should be festively trimmed, and contain
such products as milk, cream, cheese, and
eggs. As these are all necessities in housekeeping,
the financial result should be quite
large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Gowns and hats, flounces and ribbons,
form a conspicuous part of a <i>fête champêtre</i>.
Sheer grenadines, nets, and gauzes, clouds
of Valenciennes lace, beflowered organdies,
any of the effective summer costumes, the
more fetching the combination the more
satisfactory the attire. The color contrasts
are allowed to a greater extreme than for
street apparel, and brilliant colors produce
a smart effect on the lawn; and yet the
dainty white, yellow, pink, or blue fabrics
may be always afterwards worn to advantage,
they are so fresh and youthful.</p>

<p>The smart costume requires the broad-brimmed
hat coquettishly rolled, and massed
with lilacs, morning-glories, sweet-pease,
roses, or carnations, and the often added
long ribbon streamers. But the flower
toque, and the parasol of white mousseline
de soie trimmed with flowers and a flounce of
lace, and the pretty or quaint fan, aid the
charming gown in producing an artistic
effect.</p>

<p>The guests arrive in pony carriages, high
carts, or victorias, and the closed brougham,
like an old friend, is always admissible.
The host and the hostess seem especially
cordial, standing, as they do, under the
broad branches of a tall tree. Indeed, stern
Madam Propriety would deem such warmth
of welcome scarcely permissible under a
lighted chandelier. But if, as it has been
known to happen, the day of the fête should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
also be the day of the worst storm of the
entire season, the guests are received, if possible,
on the piazza, and all aid in making
merry and helping the hostess to such an
extent that people forget that a <i>fête champêtre</i>
was ever considered, and that it was
not meant to be a house party from the
beginning. Of course no one should allude
to the weather; that would be decidedly
out of form, and be very unkind to the
hostess, who certainly cannot stop the
storm.</p>

<p>In such a shaping of events refreshments
are served in-doors, if possible using the
same little tables intended for the lawn, the
cloths, which are edged about with ferns
and field-flowers in variety, added to the
pretty china and cut glass used in serving
the menu, lend the charm of beauty.</p>

<p>The menu for such a function may be the
same as that given at an evening reception,
or it may be the simple refreshment provided
for an afternoon tea, with an added
salad or ice. But as an afternoon spent in
the open air gives good appetite, liberal refreshment
will be in order.</p>

<h2>THE KING’S CHILDREN.</h2>


<p>“Pearly! Pearly!”</p>

<p>It was a woman’s shrill voice that fiercely
shrieked the name out into the morning
air.</p>

<p>We were homeward bound from the Old
Red Spring in Saratoga, when we were arrested
by her screams. The sun shone
brightly, the robins and other song birds
were trilling out their sweetest melodies, the
air was heavily scented with white clover
blossoms and sweetbrier. It was a rarely
beautiful July morning. All the world to
us was melody, save the jar made by this
thin, haggard, unkempt woman. In her
effort to be heard she travelled along the
road in the direction she thought Pearly
must have gone, crushing the daisies and
buttercups down before her.</p>

<p>Two Sabbaths before we had sat at the
communion table, and then felt a kinship to
all, that our brothers and sisters were not
only those of our very own by ties of blood,
but were close to us the round world over.
The Sabbath before, as the clergyman said,
“freely ye have received, freely give,” we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
thought more of the giving of ourselves than
of our money, more of letting others have
a share of the good gifts that had been our
lot, joy, music, loving-kindness generally,
than of offering our filthy lucre. Indeed, it
seemed a great descent, for we had been
taken up on the moment by our pastor’s
tender words, and now must remember
Vanity Fair and the necessity for money in
this worldly world. And so thinking, this
woman with the wild, disagreeable voice,
stopped us; and should we not do something
to help her, was the question put to
ourselves.</p>

<p>She was one of the resident Saratogians.
Cross, possibly, because she was tired; haggard,
because she had no time for rest. To
her the Spring waters were as a myth, and
the dry, bracing air little considered in her
work-a-day existence. We, therefore, turning
in the direction in which this woman
went, commenced our search for the little
girl, for such we decided she was, but all in
vain. Whether Pearly, familiar to the harsh
voice and recognizing extra work or disagreeable
duty as a result of coming to the
front, had hidden behind the large clumps
of elderberry bushes which grew thickly
around, or had run off to the woods for
protection, we know not; we only know that
we had to leave the woman to conclude her
search alone. But the words, “Pearly!
Pearly!” now and again caught our ear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
though indistinctly, as the distance widened
between us, and later we lost the sound altogether.
Then it was that another Pearly
came into our thought.</p>

<p>She had been baptized Margaret; but the
old-fashioned long name had been shortened
during her babyhood to the beautiful name,
“Pearl.” She has always been loving and
lovable, and always seemed consecrated,
even from her cradle. Many of the wise
people have often gravely said of her, “That
child can never live to grow up. She is too
good.” But she has lived to grow up, and,
nothing happening, in a year or two more
she will be graduated from one of our most
respected women’s colleges. She, even as
a little child, never had to be punished.
“Pearl, that is wrong; you should not act
or speak that way,” was the most serious
chiding she ever needed to receive; for
when told she had done wrong, she would
immediately say, “I will try never to do
that again.” And she invariably would
keep her promise.</p>

<p>As a schoolgirl she is a general favorite,
being popular enough to receive the unanimous
vote for class president, for Pearl is a
sunny, bright, sympathetic girl. The truly
good are always the truly happy. Her
religion is of the character to attract, not to
repel. And possibly there are nowhere to
be found keener or more severe critics than
schoolgirls are of one another. The long-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
piety, as it is sometimes called, would
receive from them only ridicule and contempt.
The abandon of youth is not slow
in exposing what they consider trustless and
wrong.</p>

<p>But my story would be too long to tell
many incidents in the life of Pearl; to tell
the many ways she has helped all with
whom her short life of eighteen years has
brought her in contact; to tell of her sympathetic
words, helpful handclasp, feet
swift to run on deeds of kindness, voice
raised in song, thus aiding others in the
schoolroom, the prayer-meeting or the
home. Indeed, Pearl was constantly forming
new ties, thus binding the hearts of all
who met her to herself.</p>

<p>The incident of which I would particularly
write is her work as a King’s Daughter.
She was one of the earliest to join this organization,
and the first band she formed
was to pay for the education of a young
girl in the same school as herself. This
young girl was the only child of a rich
father, but it was the old story—a dishonest
partner used the firm’s money for speculating
purposes, and in an evil hour all was
gone; not only money, but reputation also,
and Elsie, the only child, must now leave
school, it seemed, forever. Then it was
Pearl came to the rescue; and first binding
her ten to secrecy, because it would wound
Elsie to ever know, it was arranged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the President and officers of the school that
this band should pay for Elsie’s schooling;
and she will graduate with Pearl, all unconscious
of the one to whom she is indebted.</p>

<p>Elsie’s father was notified by the school
President that his daughter was too much
beloved not to have an opportunity to
finish her education. If he was ever able
to refund the money, all right, if not, it was
still all right; and this is all Elsie or her
father know.</p>

<p>Since then Pearl has started nine other
bands, each doing noble work for Christ and
humanity. With only one of these is she
herself connected. It every year supports
ten poor, aged women, who otherwise
would be obliged to go to the almshouse.
By the help of this King’s Daughters’ Band
these women remain in their own little
homes, passing the hours as their desires
dictate, and not feeling the pain which
Will Carleton so vividly describes in his
poem, “Over the Hills to the Poorhouse.”
No wonder that these poor old women
frequently ask God’s blessing on these young
girls, for they are so comfortable and happy
as they thus quietly wait for the summons
to the other home whose builder and maker
is God. And no wonder that Pearl wears
a happy face, for the face indicates the
heart within. The good she has done, and
may yet do, will never be known here, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
is it necessary. Sufficient for Pearl will be
the words which we hope will also be ours
some day, “Enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord.”</p>

<h2>FOR THE BOYS.</h2>


<p>Why should not the boys be as busy and
helpful as the girls?</p>

<p>Why should not the boys form their “Try
Bands,” “Working Circles” and “King’s
Sons’ Societies?”</p>

<p>There is no reason. Will not, therefore,
the willing, manly boys who read this enlist
their friends to help at least one of their
heathen brothers to a Christian education?
It is work that will give abundant reward.</p>

<p>American boys know how much care is
taken for their education. Not only are their
teachers, but their mothers, fathers, brothers
sisters and other relatives, their constant
instructors. The greatest culture and opportunity
surround them; valuable libraries
are ever at their disposal. There are numberless
free schools, art rooms and museums.
Beside the private academies, institutes, and
colleges, there are Young Men’s Christian
Association rooms, Christian Endeavor
Societies, churches and Sunday-schools, all
open and giving hearty welcome. Not so
are the privileges of the boys in India,
China and Japan. For though the Bible
and our missionaries have done a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
to help the heathen boy, his surroundings
are dark indeed, in contrast with those of
children in Christian lands. Indeed, it is
rare that a heathen boy is not a castaway
by his family when he confesses Christ.
Instead of relatives being a help to his life,
they are among his greatest sorrows.</p>

<p>Boys ought to be willing to give other
boys a chance, especially when they stand
alone. If ten boys would form a band, they
could easily collect thirty dollars a year, and
thirty dollars would pay all the yearly expenses
of a boy in a mission school or
academy. This academy prepares boys for
the theological seminary, and the seminary
fits them for the ministry. Indeed, when in
the academy, boys often go out to talk and
sing to those who do not know of Christ.
They feel sure that their heathen friends are
missing so much in not knowing Jesus, that
they cannot wait until they have completed
their studies; but as soon as they know
about Jesus themselves they are impatient
to tell others. They can talk to their friends
with greater effect than missionaries from
this country, because they understand their
customs and ways. Besides, the terrible
heat in India does not affect them as it does
people who go from this country. Very
often our missionaries and their families have
to return to America on account of their
health.</p>

<p>Some of the boys in India are very bright.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
I will tell you of one who is about fifteen
years of age, and is a student in the Arcot
Academy, India. His name is Joseph, son
of the catechist Israel; his mother’s name
is Rachel. You will notice they are all
Bible names. This family were once
heathen, but now all know and love Christ,
and are happy in working for Him. I lately
had the pleasure of reading a letter written
and composed by Joseph, without any aid
from his instructors. I wish it were possible
for my boy readers to see his penmanship;
it seemed nearly as perfect as copperplate.
Each letter was very distinct and prettily
shaded. Every word was spelled correctly,
and while his composition had not the exact
style we would use, it was very direct and
intelligible. I doubt if many American
boys of Joseph’s age could do better with a
French or German letter, or in writing in
any other language than their own. Thinking
you might be interested in hearing from
Joseph, particularly as he tells of what he
does on the Sabbath, and of his school life,
I will quote directly from his letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Madras Presidency</span>, Ranipet, India.
</div>

<div class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">Most Respected and Kind Madam</span>:</div>

<p>“My superiors, teachers and fellow-students
are doing well up to this time by the
grace of our Almighty, hoping the same for
you....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“I solicit you, dear madam, pray for me
that I may obey my superiors; I don’t like
to have the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
in vain. But I want to publish His name.</p>

<p>“Every Sunday we all go over the
country and preach about the Gospel.
Many of the heathen become Christians.</p>

<p>“There are eight bands in the school.
When we are going to preach, each band
will take three or four lyrics, some tracts, a
cymbal, and a jalar or tambourine. When
we are singing many men and women and
children will come to hear us.</p>

<p>“After our preaching is over we take account
of the men, women and children who
come to hear our preaching. Most of them
will ask questions, and we will answer them.
Many of them will abuse the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ. Though they abused
Him, we won’t leave these men, since they
don’t understand what Christ has done for
the world. We have meeting every Friday
evening, and in that meeting we will give
our reports of the men who heard the Word
of Christ.”</p></div>

<p>Referring to his studies, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Now there are four classes, viz., matriculation
class, the fifth class, the lower secondary
class, and the lower fourth class.
There are five teachers, including our manager.
Each class changes its lessons after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
one hour. Our manager teaches general
English for the four classes, and also
takes English history for the fifth class, and
science, physics and chemistry for the sixth
class. He shows many good examples and
gives us good games. He is very kind toward
us. We have many sorts of games.
Tennis and football and cricket and gymnasium
exercises. Our manager teaches us
cricket every evening.”</p></div>

<p>As this boy is writing to the one who
supports him, he closes in the following
manner:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I thank the Lord for having given me a
supporter. I render my warm and delightful
obeisance to respected and dear madam.
I remain your most obedient</p>

<div class="right">“<span class="smcap">Ponnor Isaac Joseph</span>.”</div></div>

<p>After reading this letter, which is not a
fancy sketch, picture in your mind Joseph,
his surroundings, a young Hindoo boy,
whose dark-skinned face glows enthusiastically
with his love for Christ and with his
ardent desire to tell others of his love, writing
in a strange tongue to a lady whom he
has never seen. He has her photograph, and
has received letters from her, but her voice
and manner are only conjectures in his
mind. He is writing to this lady, who has
been the means of his salvation, of freeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
him from his yoke borne by his countrymen.
Try to picture this, and then see if in your
own heart there is not a strong desire to free
more than one boy in that dark land. In
freeing one, you free others: do not forget
that.</p>

<h2>“I WISH I WERE A GENERAL.”</h2>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If wishes were horses,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beggars might ride.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Have you ever heard that, Jo?”</p>

<p>“<i>Heard</i> it, what kind of a bringing up has
a fellow had, do you think? You know well
enough that ever since I was in knickerbockers,
that immortal rhyme has been
drilled into me. I’m sick and tired of sermonizing,
and all I have to say is, if you
don’t wish for something grand, something
beyond you, you never will amount to
anything.”</p>

<p>“That is true, Jo, but wishing without
action will not accomplish much. I’ve
heard you make at least twenty wishes this
morning. One, ‘I wish I was rich!’ just
as though that were anything new; all boys
wish that. Then you wished you were
somebody great, somebody famous, like
Cæsar or the Czar of Russia, or the President
of the United States. Then you wished
your father could only let you have a college
education so that you might be a
lawyer. And then, to go on to smaller
matters, you wished it was Christmas, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
that you might have vacation. And lastly,
you wished you were a fine bicycle rider, so
that you might win the prize in the coming
race. I tell you, old fellow, I long ago
learned such a wholesome lesson on the
wishing point, that it made me over new,
so to speak.”</p>

<p>“How so, John? now I am interested,
for I thought you had been perfect from
your youth up.”</p>

<p>“Well, to begin with the beginning and
make an out-and-out confession, I’ll have to
introduce you to my Uncle Charles. I wish
you knew General Journay; I know you
would like him even if he is an odd-looking
man; he was once very handsome. He is
too sensible to think he is handsome now,
though, for there is no denying that he’s fat.
He says it is constitutional, and maybe it
is. I notice he is very uncomfortable, short
of breath, you know; gets a red face in
climbing up the stairs to the elevated road,
and all that, but he’s jolly and good, and
says he wants me to be a manly man, and
I am going to try my best to please him.
You know I am not as rich in relations as
you are, for my parents died when I was
a baby, and I never had either brothers or
sisters; perhaps that’s one reason I think so
much of you, Jo. Well, to go on with my
story, when I was about twelve years old I
went to visit for a week at my Uncle Charles’
home. He was delighted to have me with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
him, and I never tired of his companionship,
or of looking at his soldier’s uniform, his
sword and his medals. One day I said to
him, ‘Oh, Uncle, I wish I were a General,’
and he replied, ‘There is no reason why
you cannot be one, my boy, if the right
material is only in you.’”</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean by right material,
Uncle?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>“‘Why, humility, obedience, courage,
honesty, truthfulness.’</p>

<p>“‘I did not know that soldiers were ever
humble.’</p>

<p>“‘You must be humble enough to enter
the lowest ranks, obedient enough to follow
orders, courageous enough to face any
emergency, honest enough to submit to
pain rather than to steal, and truthful enough
never to soil your lips or conscience with
a lie.’</p>

<p>“Then my uncle told me of his own
boyhood, of his poverty, his hindrances, his
temptations; and I saw that the rank of
General did not come by wishing, but by
the greatest endurance, study, and hard
work. I tell you what, Jo, as I listened to
his story I felt so ashamed, and so small, I
thought I would like to crawl away in a
hole, anywhere almost, if I could only hide,
for you know my uncle is such a noble,
grand man. Then, too, my uncle told me
of our great inventors, officers, rulers, whom
the world is delighted to honor, and I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
that wishing had but little to do with their
achievements and successes. I saw I had
to buckle on my own armor and go to
work.</p>

<p>“That night I could scarcely sleep; I
kept thinking how insignificant uncle must
think me, for I knew I had often wished
for this, that and the other thing in his
presence, and so when I did sleep I
dreamed that I was in the woods, and I
thought that all the bushes and trees were
waving, and one big branch seemed like a
long, bare arm beckoning to me. I felt an
awesome, queer, uncanny feeling, and I
was sure I was losing my way. I saw one
and another path, but which one to take I
knew not, when suddenly I heard a laugh;
this frightened me so much that I jumped;
then a voice said, ‘You little goosey-gander,
what a brave soldier you would make, to be
sure, afraid of a little laugh;’ and then I
heard ha! ha! ha! and what seemed to
me to be the most uproarious laughter, the
shout of a hundred fairies. Soon a tiny old
woman approached me saying, ‘I am a
fairy queen. Ask for whatever you may
wish while you are in my domain?’</p>

<p>“At once I exclaimed: ‘I wish to be the
oldest General living.’ And there I was, a
general in very truth, but so old I could
scarcely see, so deaf I could scarcely
hear; and I was dressed in a costume
similar to my uncle’s. My hands were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
wrinkled, a long beard hung over my breast,
but it was as white as snow. My mouth
felt so queer that I lifted my hand to discover
the reason, and alas! my teeth were
all gone. I tried to walk, but I was so stiff
I could scarcely place one foot before the
other. ‘Oh, what a fool I have been,’ I
thought. ‘If only I were a boy again? Oh,
Uncle Charles, Uncle Charles!’ I screamed.</p>

<p>“‘Why, my boy, what is the matter, you
were groaning and moaning so in your
sleep, I thought something must be wrong?’
were his words.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t I grateful, though, to find it was
only a dream. It seemed too good to be
true, to learn that I was really a boy again,
that life was before, and not behind, me.
I tell you, Jo, I could scarcely wait for day
to come, to get at positive work. And since
that horrible nightmare, which taught me
the silliness of wishing, I have been a
changed boy, and I do not think I will ever
fall into that purposeless talk again. But
you don’t like sermons, excuse me, Jo.”</p>

<p>“You are a good fellow, John; I should
not be worthy of friendship such as yours,
if I did not benefit by what you have told
me. I will try to follow your example.
What do you say to our both being manly
men?”</p>

<p>“Those words have the right ring.” And
so saying the two friends walked off arm
in arm.</p>

<h2>A HEBREW CHRISTIAN.</h2>


<p>Sydney Arnheim was a Jew. I say was,
because he has thrown off the yoke of the
Jewish faith, and this little story will tell
you how it all came about.</p>

<p>Sydney is an only child; his parents are
rich; his father, a famous Wall Street broker,
is a power among his kind; his mother also
belongs to a wealthy Hebrew family, and
her refined taste and education show clearly
in her surroundings. Anything that appeals
to her exquisite judgment is purchased, so
that Sydney’s home shows everywhere the
touch of elegance, as well as the fitness of
perfection. Sydney’s own room bears the
print of her careful taste, and yet prominent
among the rich hangings and delicate furnishing
you see a Winchester rifle, a trout
pole, also a buck’s antlers, a blue crane, a
kingfisher, and several other well-known
birds, all so skilfully prepared by the taxidermist
that you could scarcely be blamed
if you thought them yet alive. Yes, Sydney
is a regular boy, and loves to keep trophies
of his sport in sight, as well as his gun and
trout pole. He says at times, “It makes it
seem as if I’m in the Adirondack woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
whenever I look at them, and simply lifting
my rod recalls some experiences with papa
in the boat with our guide, or else wading
the streams with my tutor and drawing out
big fish.” So Sydney’s mother, knowing the
comfort these recollections bring, allows her
son to place his sporting equipments just
where and as he pleases. Thus the room
has an odd, menagerie style of appearance.
And thus the home of this Israelitish family
everywhere tells of comfort and luxury.</p>

<p>Sydney, from his babyhood, was carefully
trained in the customs and belief of his
people. His mother, so frequently his companion,
constantly talked about the greatness
of his lineage, and told him of the patriarchs,
legislators, warriors, singers and
prophets which were among the Hebrew
people. She also told him of Abraham and
Moses, and of the covenant with Abraham
at Jehovah-jireh, “In thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed,” and also
what the Lord said to Jacob at Bethel, “The
land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give
it, and to thy seed.” And she daily urged
her son to walk in the footsteps and keep
the covenants of his people, and always to
serve the Lord God of Israel. The rabbi
also would frequently visit their home, and
Sydney was accustomed to talk to him, as
well as to receive the old man’s instruction
and blessing. Sydney loved to hear from
him the stories of Moses, Aaron and Joshua;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of the Tishbite and his servant Elisha; of
Solomon and the temple; of the son of
Jesse, David, the sweet singer, and of the
promise of the Messiah to come.</p>

<p>And so it was when Sydney had attained
his seventeenth year that when asked what
he would most like for his birthday-gift he
replied, “The education that will fit me the
most thoroughly to preach, not alone to my
people, but to win many erring ones, believers
in the ‘false Christ’ to turn to the
true faith.” He was at this time, therefore,
and for seven anxious, wearisome months
afterwards, the <i>Jewest</i> of all Jews, a devoted
follower of Moses, but not of the Lamb.</p>

<p>About the time of the birthday above alluded
to, there came for a visit of three
months a cousin of Sydney, a little girl about
three years his junior. She, young as she
was, however, was a Christian, and had the
Easter previous publicly confessed Christ,
and united with the same church her parents
had long attended.</p>

<p>The question might readily be asked,
“Since she was Sydney’s cousin, how was
it that she was not also a believer in the
Hebrew faith?” The reason is this. Her
mother was Sydney’s father’s sister, and
when very young, only seventeen years of
age, had surprised and grieved her family by
stating she was about to marry a gentleman
who was not of her religion. Many words
regarding the matter were exchanged at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the time, but they were useless in preventing
the marriage, and a year later she saddened
her parents yet more by renouncing
her Hebrew faith, and connecting herself
with the church of her husband. He was
a most exemplary gentleman, however, and,
notwithstanding his religion, his wife’s people
could not fail to have a most profound
respect for him. So, in time, the families
visited back and forth, but the topic of religion
was never introduced. Sydney’s father
would sometimes sigh wearily, when talking
of his sister, and say his hope was that
she would yet return to the belief of her
forefathers, and that in time all must be
well.</p>

<p>So now the little Edith was to spend
many weeks with her Jewish relations, but
she had been told to be careful about her
attendance at church, and ever watchful of
her conduct, indeed to act in every way as
the child of the dear Christ whom she loved
so well. Her mother, however, before consigning
her to her brother’s care, simply
said to her, “I will pray for you, dear, that
your faith fail not,” and “Have no fear,
mamma,” was the sweet reply. “Jesus
will be with me in Uncle Nathan’s home, as
well as in my own. Perhaps He will even
have work for me to do there. You know Dr.
M—— last Sabbath morning talked to us on
the subject of missions, and said there were
many kinds, and while we should pray and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
work for the foreign and domestic fields, we
must also remember those of our own household,
indeed, all everywhere, who do not love
the Saviour.” So Edith’s mother had no
fear for her child, and into the uncle’s home
there came a blessing, the measure of which
cannot be counted by any earthly rule or
computation, for who can measure the joy
of even one soul turned to the Saviour?</p>

<p>Edith and Sydney were now great friends,
for while they had known each other always,
the constant companionship led to the
warmest friendship, and they were therefore
as good comrades as a boy and girl cousin
could well be. Neither religion nor any
topic bearing on it was ever discussed before
Edith. She never attended their church,
nor they hers. When the Sabbath came she
would always be accompanied to the church
door, and when the service was out some
member of the family would be found without
waiting to walk home with her, and
during her entire visit neither by word or
action was she allowed to feel she stood
apart from her Jewish relations, and therefore
the time passed all too rapidly onward.
She remembered her promise to her mother,
and most earnestly she prayed to God to
direct and help her. She also prayed for
her uncle and aunt, imploring the Father in
heaven to lead them into the light; but
particularly she prayed for her cousin Sydney.
They were such comrades, so nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
of an age, and yet she felt there was a great
gulf fixed, and therefore she constantly plead
that he might learn of the Christ, the Saviour.</p>

<p>One day, just after a most fervent prayer
for Sydney, her cousin approached her unobserved
while she was reading from the
New Testament. He exclaimed, on seeing
the title, “Why, Edith, I never had a copy
of that book in my hands. I should like to
read yours sometime, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Mind! why no, Sydney. Take it along
with you now.”</p>

<p>And he did. When her cousin left, Edith
prayed as she never had before, beseeching
the Father to let the scales drop from his
eyes and show unto him the Christ. And
God did open the boy’s eyes. He did not
read through a glass darkly, but with clearest
vision. The brightest light fell on the
divine Word, the light which later led to his
giving up his old Hebrew faith, and his acceptance
of Jesus.</p>

<p>All did not come at once. At the first reading
he was troubled, anxious, but not satisfied.
He had many old questions to settle;
he had much pride to put aside; he spent
many hours, and at times away into the
night in prayer. But peace at last came,
the peace which he feels will endure until
the day when he will see the King in His
beauty.</p>

<p>And now Sydney longs for the conversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
of his parents, and of all of his people.
His wish is to preach Christ, and so
do all in his power to lead his brethren, the
Jews, unto the everlasting joy of the New
Jerusalem.</p>

<h2>THE BABY’S LESSON.</h2>


<p>It was blossom-time, and in the quiet of
the early May morning the church bells
rung out their loving call. “Come, come,
come!” they seemed to say, and, accepting
the invitation, we shortly found ourselves
sitting, with other strangers, in the Episcopal
church of a favorite resort.</p>

<p>It was during the Scripture lesson that a
little maiden of about four years of age
quietly walked up the long aisle, looking to
right and left, scanning the faces in every
pew, until she had reached the chancel.
The clergyman’s voice was no doubt
familiar to her, for she showed no timidity.
Not seeing the one she sought, she turned
and tripped down the aisle again. But on
nearing the door she put out her hands and
extended her arms in a pleading baby fashion,
as if to say, “I do not want to go
away. I cannot find my papa or mamma,
but will not some one lift me up? I came
to church to stay.” And a kind-hearted
man, seeing the gesture, took up the baby
beside him.</p>

<p>The little one reverently entered into the
worship of the hour. As prayer followed
prayer, the blue eyes closed tight, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
wavy golden hair fell forward over the bent
head. At the time of singing she rose with
others, and her voice carolled out the tune,
though her words were those of her own
devising. One little hand tightly clasped
a penny, and as the collection-plate was
passed she eagerly dropped in her contribution.</p>

<p>It was time to go home, and as nearly all
present were strangers, many watched to
see what the baby girl would do. A mother
by my side said to her, “I have a little girl
at home, about as big as you. I would not
want her to be lost, and if you will tell me
where you live I will take you home.” Then
a quiet dignity seemed to possess the wee
maiden, as with courteous action she pointed
to a large white house about one hundred
feet away. Lifting the blue eyes to the
lady’s face, she replied, “I live there. I
love to come to church, and I thought I
should find papa; he always goes, but”—gravely
shaking her curls—“I couldn’t find
him this morning. But I can go home by
my own self.” And then, child fashion, she
ran on, as though to satisfy us that she knew
the way.</p>

<p>Walking under the apple boughs back to
the hotel, we thought of the sermon this
child’s presence had preached. And the
question came, Why do not all parents so
train their little ones that they love God’s
house? This little girl had given the congregation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
a lesson which should make a
children’s day of every Sabbath the year
around. The Bible says, “Their angels do
always behold the face of the Father,” and
“Unless ye become as a little child, ye cannot
enter the kingdom.”</p>

<p>Where young children sit side by side
with their parents in church, and so learn to
“remember the Sabbath day,” they will
early wish to consecrate their lives to Christ.
They will not enter heaven “so as by fire,”
but “as kings crowned,” for they will not
wait to work for the Master until the time
when the “grinders shall cease because they
are few, and those that look out of the windows
be darkened,” but will use the hours
of every day as in God’s sight, and in the
companionship of Him who is invisible.</p>

<h2>PARLOR FORTUNE-TELLING.</h2>


<p>Nothing so much lends enchantment to the
hours or wings them to merry flight as fortune-telling.
And particularly fascinating is
the art of foretelling the future through the
medium of palm-reading. When a bright
girl who has the faculty of revealing character
and prophesying the future by inspecting
the hand is in a drawing-room, the
hostess need not fear for the pleasure of her
guests, for the fair magician will take care
of beaux and belles alike, leading them on
to happy marriages and boundless wealth
(for no real fortune-teller ever forgets matrimony
and money). Nor will the young
people alone be anxious to learn what is
written in the palms of their hands, for more
or less superstition lingers with us all. And
what if there has been a small error regarding
character-reading, or a trifling discrepancy
relative to past events, one happy
guess will cause all such mistakes to be
forgotten: and besides, the necessity for
verification is seldom urgent. Palmistry is
not altogether pastime, any more than divination
is altogether jugglery, for no hand is
exactly like another hand; the intersection
of the lines, the stars, the mounts, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
texture, really do supply a guide to the
character of the owner. And if, added to
the knowledge of hand-reading, you are a
student of the face—and every one is more
or less a physiognomist—you will arrive at
fairly correct conclusions.</p>

<p>Palmistry is linked with astrology: the
first finger belongs to Jupiter, the middle to
Saturn, the third to the Sun, the small finger
to Mercury; Venus is in the thick part below
the thumb, the plain of Mars is directly
under the mount of Mercury, the moon controls
all beneath the kingdom of Mars. This
link between the planets and the hand was
arbitrary; astronomers distributed deities
among the planets, and the planets were
supposed to partake of the nature of the gods
and to influence life.</p>

<p>Palmistry also depends on analogy and
symbolism. Every mark on the hand has
some mystical meaning. A star denotes
success, barred lines indicate obstacles;
where several parallel lines are formed instead
of one, they show a variety of pursuits,
instead of force only in one direction.
If lines are long, gently curved, and red,
they indicate a gentle disposition; if you
have a special talent, there will surely be a
perpendicular line from the base of the hand
toward the fingers; this line is sometimes
doubled. Long tapering fingers indicate
high mental qualities, a love of the arts, a
thirst for knowledge, and strength of memory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
while the contrary shows a tendency
to rapid progress at first, only to be followed
by failure in all intellectual undertakings.
People with short fingers are apt to be impulsive,
if they are very short, they indicate
lack of tact. Long-fingered people go into
detail, and are punctiliously careful about
trifles. Twisted fingers with short nails
show tyranny and a worrying temperament.
If the fingers fit closely together, their owner
is apt to be avaricious; if smooth, they indicate
indiscretion and talkativeness. But if
twisted and showing spaces between, the
person is sympathetic and generous. Sensitiveness
is shown by the small fleshy protuberances,
which stand out from the curved
surface of the finger-tips. If your fingers
are broad, you will love things for their
practical uses; your taste will be for industries,
mechanics, commerce. If your finger-tips
are square, you will be fond of literature,
logic, language, you will be inclined
to theorize, and you will have respect for
authority. The joints of the fingers have an
importance, so they too must be carefully
examined. Indeed, no one part of the hand
can be taken alone; a joint or a line or a
mount may so change the meaning of what
you have already observed, as to greatly
modify your conclusions. Conic fingers
show a love for the beautiful, the ideal and
romantic, but the well-developed joints may
add moral force, as also does a large thumb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Hands that are always white, regardless of
temperature, tell of selfishness and conceit,
lack of sympathy for the sorrows of others.
Soft hands tell of a lazy, lethargic temperament;
hard hands show a love of exercise
and labor. Soft hands indicate tenderness
rather than fidelity, while hard hands indicate
true love, but not much tenderness or
passion. Smoothness of the hands shows
delicacy of mind. A wrinkled hand, if soft,
shows sensitiveness; if hard, irritability.
Pale lines in a hand show a phlegmatic disposition,
in a man amounting to effeminacy.</p>

<p>Each mount is of as much import as are
the indications found on the fingers. On
the mount of Jupiter you will learn of honor,
ambition, religion. If it is very large it
shows tyranny and ostentation; if small,
idleness, egoism, vulgarity. A cross found
on this mount will tell of a happy marriage;
if a star is found as well, the marriage will
be wealthy and satisfactory to the highest
degree. A spot on this mount shows ignominy
and dishonor.</p>

<p>The mount of Saturn, which is at the base
of the second finger, tells of caution, credulousness,
timidity. If very large, the individual
will be melancholy, quiet, and morbid.
A solitary line on this mount indicates bad
fortune.</p>

<p>The mount of the Sun, when prominent,
insures success, genius, pride, eloquence.
If the mount is extremely large, wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
extravagance, luxury. A single line on this
mount means glory.</p>

<p>Below the little finger on the outside of
the hand we look for the mount of Mercury,
and there learn of invention, speculation,
agility. Excess of this mount indicates
cunning, treachery, and falsehood.</p>

<p>Below this mount we find Mars, which if
very prominent, shows the owner to be
brusque and violent; if it is small, look out
for cowardice and meanness.</p>

<p>The mount of the Moon, which is found
lower still, denotes a love of the mysterious;
those possessing this mount to a high degree
are also inclined to revery, as well as to
idleness. They are likewise capricious,
changeful, and irritable. In hard hands you
will also read discontent and fanaticism.</p>

<p>The most important of all the lines on the
hand is the line of life. If long, clear, and
straight, it shows long life and good character;
if pale and broad, the indications are
ill health and a weak disposition; if thick
and red, the owner is apt to be violent to
brutality; if varying in thickness, this will
show a fitful and high temper.</p>

<p>The greatest caution must be used by any
reader of the hand, and before even a pretension
is made to judge character or to
foretell the future, much careful study of the
many books on this subject should be given.
The student must learn from different authorities,
as well as by thoughtful study and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
comparison for himself. Many rules must
be applied, and there are many conflicting
forces to harmonize. The hand is of the
utmost importance in human economy.
Aristotle denominated it “the organ of the
organs.” After the murder of Cicero at
Caieta, not only his head but also his hands
were exhibited in the Roman Forum. The
homologies have been traced between the
human hand and the paws of the brute creation,
and it has been proved that to man
alone was the perfect hand given, exquisite
in beauty as well as paramount in usefulness.</p>

<p>Palmistry is an old science. As early as
the year 1504 there was a book published in
the city of London on <i>The Art of Foretelling
the Future Events by Inspection of the Hand</i>.
It has been asserted that Homer wrote on
the lines of the hand. Probably most people
are familiar with the verse assigned by
the superstitions as Scriptural warrant for
indulging in this popular art: Job xxxvii.
7, “He sealeth the hand of every man, that
all may know his work.”</p>

<h2>CHURCH COURTESY.</h2>


<p>It was only a smile as the Hymn-book
and Psalter were offered; it did not cost
the young man anything, but it gave us, the
recipients of his courtesy, pleasant satisfaction.
We did not feel as if the books were
grudgingly given, but rather that a sympathetic
bond had united us, that we would
like to know this cordial generous young
fellow, and thought if this were a sample
of the people in that church, we would like
to make it our home. The entire service
was so heightened by the incident that we
scarcely missed our old familiar surroundings,
and really had almost forgotten that
we were strangers, so one with us the people
appeared; and when the preacher later
gave for his text the words, “The greatest of
these is Love,” it seemed only natural that
this should have been the thought selected.</p>

<p>By contrast, we felt severely the difference
which the following Sabbath brought. It
was again the early service, and we sat
strangers in another city church. The opening
hymn, which was not a familiar one,
was announced, and an old man sitting in a
pew behind gave us his book. Two young
men occupying the seat with him each had
a hymn-book with notes, but instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
looking on the same book, so having one to
spare, they each selfishly kept their own,
neither offering one to the old gentleman
who, I later learned, had gone without for
our sake, nor giving a book to two ladies
who were in the pew with me, and were
strangers like ourselves. As a result, we all
felt uncomfortable; the clergyman’s sermon,
excellent though it was, did not meet with
proper response. Our thoughts were divided,
the atmosphere was unpleasant, we
claimed that the church seemed very cheerless,
that even the lighting of it was not satisfactory,
and, indeed, we were so unhappy
by the ungracious action of the two young
men back of us that we were glad when the
benediction was pronounced, and we could,
borrowing an illustration from the time of
the Apostles, shake the dust off our feet, and
turn toward home.</p>

<p>The question is sometimes asked, Why
are there so many vacant pews in our
churches? And the blame is laid on the
hard-working minister. Well, his shoulders
are broad and accustomed to carrying burdens.
All the sorrows and annoyances of
the people become a part of his daily load.
But stop. Let us put the answer to this
question where it belongs, not on the minister,
but nine-tenths of the time on the congregation.
“Be not forgetful to entertain
strangers,” are the words of the Bible, and
we cannot go to a better book for advice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
“Be courteous,” are also two words found
there.</p>

<p>A young man, not a church-goer, once
said to me, “I wandered into Dr. L.’s church
the other morning, and I was shown into
one of the very best pews. Later the family
came, and they gave me every attention.
When the service was over, the gentleman
who sat at the head of the pew allowed his
family to pass out, and waited for me.
Then offering his hand, said he was very
glad I had been put in his pew, and he
hoped I would come to church again very
soon, every Sunday if I would, and then he
added, ‘Young man, don’t ask an usher for
a seat, come right in here with me any time.’</p>

<p>“Now,” continued this young gentleman,
“that’s what I call business. I enjoyed
the service that morning, was not made
to feel as if I was an offscourer, but as if I
was welcome. I’ll go again soon; that’s
the right kind of a church. The singing
was beautiful, and I’m fond of music; the
sermon, too, touched the right place, but I
think what had more to do with it than anything
else, was that courteous family and
the hearty hand-shake afterwards.”</p>

<p>We, neither of us, can weigh the influence
we have on our neighbor. Perhaps it is
better for our own peace we cannot. But
we must remember a smile may save a soul.
“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
the least of these, ye have done it unto me.”</p>

<h2>A BRAVE BOY.</h2>


<p>“How shall our class raise one hundred
dollars for the benefit of the church-debt
fund?” was a question recently put to eight
young girls by their Sunday-school teacher.</p>

<p>“Have a fair in the early fall; we will
work for it all summer,” was the first answer.</p>

<p>“No; that might interfere with the ladies’
fair, which comes during December. It is
to be a mammoth one this year, and we
must not anticipate the event nor risk retarding
its prosperity, but rather do our part to
push it forward.”</p>

<p>“Suppose, then, we have a cake sale,”
was the suggestion by the eldest one of the
party. That was at once vetoed, as more
properly belonging to our mothers and
grandmothers.</p>

<p>“I tell you what, girls!” ejaculated Jessie,
“let us make candy; get all the orders
we can and supply our customers. We can
make lots of money that way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we can get the customers,”
added Hattie, “<i>I</i> thought maybe we could
get up an entertainment, and so I brought a
book containing a colloquy in three parts,
which will just take in all of us. There are
eight characters, so it would fit exactly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good for you, Hattie,” was the quick
reply, and the bright eyes and excited manner
of each of the scholars showed that such
enthusiasm could not fall to result in success.</p>

<p>Later a satisfactory programme was arranged,
consisting of music, recitations,
tableaux and the above-mentioned colloquy.
The entertainment was to be given in the
parlors of one of the scholars, and the tickets
for young and old were to be offered for the
sum of twenty-five cents each.</p>

<p>My! how the girls worked, not alone in
the necessary preparation for their part of
the programme, but in the sale of tickets,
which were disposed of rapidly.</p>

<p>At last the much-looked-for night had
come, and never did stars seem more brilliant,
or moonlight more beautiful. Such a
crowd! Long before the time for showing
the tableaux, which were to open the entertainment,
the parlors and halls and even
the stairs were full. A man was stationed
at the door to receive the tickets and any
money which might be offered.</p>

<p>But was it any wonder that little Theodore
Vandervoort, who is connected with one of
the younger classes of the Sunday-school,
found himself surrounded by so many bigger
and older people, that he was not seen? or
that the money he had expected to give at
the door should not be taken?</p>

<p>What a temptation this now presented!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
His father and mother would never know.
The twenty-five cents would buy a great
deal of candy, or the new ball he wanted so
much, or a box of figs, or several bananas,
of which he was very fond. But no, Theodore
was an honest boy and would therefore
scorn to use money which was not his own.
This twenty-five cents had been given to
him to pay for the entertainment he was now
enjoying, and he would not expend it for
any other purpose. So the following morning,
before he entered school, he paid his
debt, personally going to the house of the
teacher who had charge of the entertainment
and, with a few words of explanation,
leaving the money.</p>

<p>And so Theodore Vandervoort proved
himself a hero, an example to many an older
boy, as well as to many fathers and mothers.</p>

<p>Even in a small boy we see the future
man, and if God wills that Theodore Vandervoort
shall grow to manhood, we are not
afraid to predict great things of him, to
prophesy that he will be a man above reproach,
a king among his fellows.</p>

<p>May the boys who read this story beware
of falling into temptation, or doing the first
dishonest act; but rather let them be brave,
noble and upright, as was little Theodore,
and so receive not only peace of conscience
in the present life, but the joy which is
eternal.</p>

<p>As for the entertainment, it met with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
success that generally attends zeal and hard
work, and so overflowing was the treasury
that the girls scarcely needed the added
twenty-five cents. Yet honest Theodore,
in taking his first opportunity to get out of
debt, which is out of danger also, had set
for all who read these words an excellent
example.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
